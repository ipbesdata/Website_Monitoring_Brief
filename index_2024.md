### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Rangers from across the Southern African region have now established a new community of practice for monitoring and reporting on elephant mortality](https://cites.org/eng/news/empowering-data-driven-elephant-conservation-cites-mike-programme-ranger-training-sawc). Accurate and consistent data on elephant deaths is crucial for understanding and effectively addressing the threats faced by nature's gardeners, which include human=elephant conflict, habitat loss and the illegal killing for ivory. Reliable data allows for informed decision-making and effective conservation measures to ensure the long-term survival of African elephants in their natural habitats. 

2. [Two new studies show promising trends for Tanzania's rare creatures and protected habitats](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/studies-reveal-conservation-successes-for-wildlife-and-habitats-in-tanzania): regulations and management are having a positive impact on the trade of [chameleons](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300371) and [effectiveness of forest nature reserves](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281408) help to safeguard the east African country's rich biodiversity. Tanzania was the largest exporter of chameleons for the pet trade until 2016, when the export of all live wild-sourced animals was banned. For the second study, the effectiveness of 21 nature forest reserves (out of 26 in total, but there was no data available for the other 5) was measured with the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool, which uses input information on a range of social, environmental and economic issues and generates a score for a protected area, with a maximum of 99. The score rose from 55 in 2015 (for the 11 nature forest reserves for which data was available) to 87 (for 17 nature forest reserves), and over time the proportion of endemic species whose ranges were not covered by NFRs decreased: only 5% of endemic mammals' ranges did not fall under the protection of NFRs, and 10% of endemic reptiles' ranges.

3. Despite global commitments to halt deforestation by 2030, [only 8 of the top 20 countries with the highest rate of tropical deforestation have quantified targets on forests in their national climate action plans](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/national-climate-action-plans-have-insufficient-forest-targets-and-deforestation-continues-to-rise), also known ad Nationally Determined Contributions. The new UN-REDD report [Raising ambition, accelerating action: Towards enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions for forests](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/raising-ambition-accelerating-action-towards-enhanced-nationally-determined) reveals a major gap in forest protection, management and restoration in current NDCs, which outline plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change.

4. A new report, [Closing the Gap: investing in Natural Capital to meet the Sustainable Development Goals](https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT607) explores [how much 40 strategically chosen countries need to invest to meet key SDGs linked to nature conservation and restoration, more efficient use of natural resources and the reduction of water and air pollution](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/funding-nature-related-sustainable-development-goals-would-deliver-more-than-20-times-return-on-investment-study-shows). It then analyses the resulting return on investment in terms of benefits for nature and human wellbeing, calculated as an economic equivalent. It estimates that 7.4 trillion USD would need to be invested between now and 2030 to meet 9 key nature-related SDG targets, and closing the natural capital gap would generate the economic equivalent of 152 trillion USD (20 USD for every dollar spent). Meeting the targets would also avoid nearly 4.5 million premature deaths every year between now and 2030, avoid more than 27 million hectares of deforestation, reduced natural resource extraction by nearly 18 billion tonnes, restore more than 250 million hectares of agricultural land and increase terrestrial protected areas by 396,000 hectares and marine protected areas by 218,000 hectares.

5. The region of Asturias in [Northern Spain saw its largest single wildfire in recorded history in 2023](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/scientists-and-community-leaders-respond-one-spains-largest-fires-history), with a total of 10,096 hectares of land burned. A team of regional and national government forestry technicians, researchers, emergency service and forest service personnel and community members assessed changes in the soil and vegetation caused by fires. This data will be used for a more proactive approach to future fires.

6. GBIF is seeking [expert input](https://www.gbif.org/news/7uqv8Td2laX7Q4MMhCHEft/community-consultation-opens-for-freshwater-data-publishing-guide) and feedback from community members until the 15th of August 2024 to facilitate the release of a [new guide on the publishing of freshwater data](https://docs.gbif-uat.org/freshwater-data-publishing-guide/en/). The guide aims to describe best practices for formatting and publishing data derived from freshwater ecosystem sampling within the GBIF infrastructure.

7. [Europe's forests face increasing pressures](https://www.wri.org/insights/europe-forest-loss-drivers): climate change-induced wildfires, insect outbreaks and, most recently, increased wood harvesting to meet additional demand for 'home-grown' biomass in response to the Ukraine war and changing energy demands. Over the past two decades, the extent of Europe's tall forests (forests with trees taller than 15 metres) declined by 2.25 million hectares. Tall forests are critical for storing carbon and hosting biodiversity. When an area of tall forest is logged or burnt down, it will often regain tree cover from replanting or natural regeneration, however, the new trees can take decades to grow to the point where they provide the equivalent climate and ecosystem benefits of a mature forest, and ecosystem benefits may never be recovered in cases where only one or two species are planted in place of mature stands with a diversity of species. Europe's forests have been increasingly affected by insect outbreaks, due to global warming and poor forest management practices. In Germany, timber harvesting rates reportedly dropped by 10% from 2022 to 2023, but satellite data shows a 42% increase in tree cover loss in the same period, suggesting the loss was not related to harvesting. 

8. [Building resilient coastal communities through Nature-based Solutions and empowerment tools](https://www.es-partnership.org/building-resilient-coastal-communities-through-nature-based-solutions-and-empowerment-tools/). According to [EKLIPSE's final report](https://eklipse.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Eklipse-EmpowerUs-Report-1-24-Building-RCC_final2.pdf), the majority of studies addressed NbS and ET together, indicating that the integration of participatory approaches and ET at various stages and levels within NbS projects can effectively foster empowerment, and as a consequence, social ecological resilience. Coastal environments held the dominant presence in NbS studies, while the prevailing NbS approaches included Ecosystem-based Adaptation and Ecosystem-based Management. Most of these case studies favoured a top-down governance process, focussing on informing or consulting communities rather than actively involving or empowering them.

9. ['Remarkable' progress made towards incorporating Traditional Knowledge into the biodiversity plan](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/remarkable-progress-made-towards-incorporating-traditional-knowledge-into-the-biodiversity-plan). Countries must respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities to achieve the world's major international commitment on biodiversity. This includes acknowledging Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' rights to nature and their contributions to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Monitoring how their rights are realised is crucial. Traditional knowledge indicators are a key tool to embed Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' actions in the implementation and the monitoring processes of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The four key traditional knowledge indicators that relate to Indigenous Peoples' collective rights are: trends in linguistic diversity and numbers of speakers of Indigenous languages; trends in land-use change and land tenure in the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; trends in the practice of traditional occupations; and trends in the degree to which traditional knowledge and practices are respected. 

**Climate**
1. ELATIA, the Indigenous Peoples' Global Partnership on Climate Change, Forests and Sustainable Development, has been selected to [conduct a comprehensive Global Data Study on Indigenous Peoples' Climate Contributions](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/elatia-winner-of-global-indigenous-climate-finance-study-bid/). This study aims to bolster long-term access to climate finance for Indigenous Peoples by meticulously documenting their efforts in climate action across the seven socio-cultural regions.

2. [London faces significant flood risks due to rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storms driven by climate change](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-plan-to-protect-london-from-the-growing-flood-threat/). The Thames Barrier, crucial for the city's protection, was originally designed for a 1-in-1,000 year storm surge. However, with the current pace of climate change-induced sea-level rise, this protection level is diminishing, leaving the city more vulnerable. TEAM2100 has been launched to improve London's flood defences, which involve regular inspections, upgrades and refurbishments, and asset management. 

3. The CEO of the Nature Conservancy, Jennifer Morris, addresses the [urgent need for more innovative climate adaptation strategies](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/the-nature-conservancy-ceo-jennifer-morris-we-are-in-the-age-of-adaptation/), emphasising transforming stakeholder engagement and enhancing financial support mechanisms, advocating for governance by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Up until this point, climate adaptation finance has been largely theoretical and nowhere near the scale needed. It is not uncommon to secure a two-year funding commitment for a project that needs seven to ten years of partnership to see real change. 

4. [Canada's Record-breaking 2023 wildfires released nearly 4 times more carbon than global aviation](https://www.wri.org/insights/canada-wildfire-emissions), caused billions of dollars in property damage and displaced thousands of people from their homes. Roughly 7.8 million hectares of forests were burned, more than 6 times the annual average since 2001. This amount of tree cover loss produced roughly 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide, nearly 4 times the carbon emissions of the global aviation sector in 2022, and 25% more than from all tropical primary forest loss combined in 2023.

**Oceans**
1. Challenger 150, which coordinates a global effort to map life in the deep sea, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project, an initiative dedicated to inspiring and coordinating the global effort to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade. [Consolidating the physical and biological ocean data being identified and produced by the two separate initiatives will greatly advance our understanding of the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/major-boost-for-oceanic-research-as-challenger-150-joins-forces-with-seabed-2030/). The [latest percentage of ocean floor mapped, 26.1%](https://oceandecade.org/news/seabed-2030-announces-latest-progress-on-world-hydrography-day/), marked an increase of 4.34 million square kilometres of new data, which is the equivalent to an area the size of the European Union, and led to discoveries such as the largest known deep sea coral reef habitat, spanning over 6.4 million acres on the Blake Plateau, off the southeast coast of the USA. [Four underwater mountains were discovered](https://schmidtocean.org/four-new-seamounts-discovered-in-the-high-seas/) using multibeam mapping techniques. And [over 100 potential new marine species have been identified](https://schmidtocean.org/underwater-mountains-harbor-abundant-life/) during a single deep sea expedition.

2. Great Barrier Reef Traditional Owners are sharing their world-leading approach to weaving Traditional Knowledge with Western science, in a bid to help protect coral reefs as the world grapples with the 4th global mass coral bleaching event. A new campaign, ['The World is Watching'](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-world-is-watching-as-traditional-owners-lead-the-way-in-reef-protection/), was launched at the UN Ocean Decade Conference in Barcelona, to elevate Traditional Owners' voices and showcase how their world-first co-design and co=delivery model for conservation is setting a new global standard for Indigenous-led solutions. 

3. BULA Reef off Plantation Island Resort's coast in Malolo District, Fiji, is now [the largest rescue reef of its kind in history](https://oceandecade.org/news/launching-fijis-bula-reef/), written in over a thousand heat-adapted 'super corals', taken from areas of extreme heat stress where corals were in danger of dying due to an approaching marine heat wave. The word 'BULA' is a Fijian greeting, and means 'life'. The BULA Reef is the world's biggest word ever written underwater, at 16 x 45 metre. 

4. The [first-ever SeaVoice book](https://oceandecade.org/news/seavoice-launches-first-book-uplifting-coastal-voices-in-un-endorsed-initiative/), backed by the United Nations Ocean Decade, has launched, and features a curated selection of 20 stories from 16 countries that highlight the voices of ocean advocates, scientists, artists and community members working and living around the ocean. Only 500 copies are being printed, and [the books can be ordered](https://www.seavoice.online/theannual) for free, with readers paying for postage and packaging.

5. The [Ocean Census Arctic Deep Expedition has documented extraordinary biodiversity](https://oceandecade.org/news/unveiling-life-in-the-arctic-abyss-ocean-census-expedition-reveals-biodiversity-wonders-at-lifes-extremes/), such as shrimps covered in hair-like bacteria feasting on methane, stalked jellyfish resembling underwater flowers, armoured crustaceans, forests of tube worms, fish with antifreeze proteins in their blood and animals living with bacteria that can turn toxic chemicals into energy, living thousands of metres below the Arctic surface in a region now threatened by ocean warming and deep seabed mining. 

6. Global Fishing Watch and the Gulf of Guinea Regional Fisheries Commission launched a [new strategic partnership to address urgent maritime challenges in the Gulf of Guinea](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-and-gulf-of-guinea-regional-fisheries-commission-forge-partnership-in-fight-against-illegal-fishing/), including that of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The Gulf has long been subject to IUU fishing, with damages estimated at an annual economic loss of over 2 billion USD. 

7. [Recent statistics on marine biodiversity conservation have been published in the IOC State of the Ocean Report 2024](https://www.obis.org/2024/06/03/stor-2024/), reveal interesting statistics on how much we know about which species, especially those threatened with extinction, occur in Marine Protected Areas. As of now, 93,106 marine species have been documented within these designated areas, marking a significant milestone in the effort to preserve marine life. These records, compiled from nearly 50 million distribution data points, highlight that half of these data were collected in the past eight years, indicating a growing focus on these protected regions. It was found that over half of all, and 72% of threatened, species have been reported in Marine Protected Areas occupying 9% of the world's ocean. For the majority of the threatened species, only a small fraction (median 7%) of their habitat falls within Marine Protected Areas.

8. The UN Ocean Decade [White Paper on Challenge 7](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390124.locale=en), 'Expand the Global Ocean Observing System', [strongly advocates for a transformative era for ocean observing](https://goosocean.org/news/un-ocean-decade-challenge-7-white-paper-a-roadmap-for-the-observing-system-we-need/), setting the path for a robust, responsive, and sustainable observing system. The white paper highlights significant gaps in the current ocean observing system, including insufficient observational coverage, especially in deep ocean and polar regions, and the need for improved data integration and sharing. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. From monitoring climate change to preserving biodiversity, [AI-driven technologies empower researchers to gather and analyse data with heightened levels of precision and efficiency](https://earthobservations.org/news/harnessing-ai-earth-observations-all). GEO Work Programmes have started using AI: in a survey conducted in early 2024, around half of GEO Work Programme activities identified themselves as advanced or medium in the level of AI applications, where AI is often used for image classification, change detection and predictive modelling. For example, a GEO initiative providing flood forecasts globally with 15-days lead time based on historical data and near-term observations is using a trained global model with available local in-situ measures to capture similarities in hydrological behaviours so that river runoff and discharge forecasts can be made for areas without gauges.

2. A [comprehensive remote sensing forecast for wheat pests and diseases across Asia, Europe and North America](https://earthobservations.org/news/geo-project-forecasts-global-wheat-pest-and-disease-implications) has shown that the main types of wheat pests are rust and aphids, which can both lead to significant yield loss. The forecasted total area affected by these issues is about 24,8 million hectares.

**News and updates about applications**
1. Forest monitoring in communal territories has been going on for many years and has been embraced strongly, becoming a core part of the culture of Indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Despite threats, these communities were able to decrease deforestation in their areas by more than 50% in just a year when using satellite data from Global Forest Watch in their monitoring. Now, [Indigenous leaders in Peru are working collaboratively to develop new resources using MapBuilder](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/indigenous-communities-peru-amazon-mapbuilder/), a tool that is helping them to control the data and narrative around deforestation in their territories and the threats they face to better work together, target solutions, and guard and defend their territories against latent threats to ancestral forests. 

2. [MapTiler Engine 13.3 has been released](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/06/merging-tilesets-in-maptiler-engine-13-3/). The key benefits are the possibility to merge multiple tilesets into a single file, which makes updating large tilesets with new data more efficient, improved performance for all input data formats, both raster and vector data, and MapTiler Engine can now be tried for free for 2 weeks, without the need for credit card details.

**Indices and indicators**
1. The Copernicus Marine Service announced the [Mean Sea Level anomalies indicator for Europe](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/june-2024-release). The change in Mean Sea Level is a key indicator of our evolving climate. It reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Due to its importance for understanding the state of the ocean and impacts of global warming, Copernicus Marine is launching this new [Ocean Monitoring Indicator](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-monitoring-indicators).

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [new OBIS Data Policy for data sharing and use](https://www.obis.org/2024/06/19/data-policy-stors/) in OBIS is [available](https://manual.obis.org/policy.html). The policy aligns with the new UNESCO IOC Data Policy and Terms of Use, and emphasises the importance of adhering to the FAIR and CARE Principles, data quality, accessibility and transparency. It outlines specific requirements for data submission, including metadata standards, quality control procedures, and protocols for data updates and corrections, and addresses issues including data ownership, citation, and intellectual property rights.

2. [DataCite launched a pilot to help track awards and related outputs](https://datacite.org/blog/guidance-for-registering-datacite-dois-for-awards/). Traditionally, research funding organisations create and manage grant and award-related information internally and track the impact of their investments through elaborate reporting procedures. These processes can be improved by leveraging DOIs and metadata. 

3. [Data Stewardship Wizard and FAIRsharing collaborate to share policy, database and standard metadata](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=824). Data management plans (DMPs) play the crucial role of outlining researchers' intentions in following best practices to ensure datasets, code and other digital objects are FAIR. To develop effective DMPs, authors of those DMPs must be able to unambiguously and explicitly identify and name the community standards (e.g. terminologies, models, formats, minimal information requirements), and databases (repositories, knowledge bases) appropriate for describing and sharing their type of digital object (e.g., datasets, software, survey) within their discipline(s), as well as know the requirements of their funder's policy. FAIRsharing provides not only manually-curated records for standards, databases and policies, but also a [rich graph of the connectivity among these resources](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=806), placing each record within the broader context of the research data landscape. Key features of this new collaborative phase include identifiability (FAIRsharing DOIs which will be extended to policies), connectivity (making relationships among standards, databases and policies accessible to DSW users), and machine actionability (further enhancing the creation of machine-actionable DMPs through the use of FAIRsharing DOIs within DMPs and the ability to pull appropriate resource metadata from FAIRsharing records following the principles of Linked Open Data).

### Issue 3
Date: 3 June 2024

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The [online learning tool](https://www.ipbes.net/ias/learning) featuring interactive graphical elements, animations and case studies from the IPBES Invasive Alien Species Report was launched. 

2. [Degradation of nature could reduce UK GDP by 12% as early as 2030](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/degradation-of-nature-could-reduce-uk-gdp-by-12-per-cent). Researchers at UNEP-WCMC have contributed to the [first analysis to quantify the impact of nature degradation on a country's economy](https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GFI-UK-NATURE-RELATED-RISKS-FULL-REPORT.pdf), which included soil health decline, global food security repercussions, zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The estimated loss is larger than that resulting from the global financial crisis and Covid-19 pandemic, and nature-related risks are as detrimental or more to the economy as those from climate risks. However, while the economic costs of climate change are becoming increasingly accepted, the risks posed by nature degradation amount to a material cost that has not been sufficiently factored into financial and business decision-making. 

3. The [largest modelling study of its kind to date shows an urgent need for policies that better understand the interlinked nature of climate change and biodiversity loss](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/largest-modelling-study-of-its-kind-highlights-need-for-joined-up-climate-and-biodiversity-policy) and their potential impacts on human societies. Global biodiversity declined by between 2 and 11% during the 20th century due to land-use change alone, according to the [large multi-model study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn3441) which was published in Science last month. Projections show that climate change could become the main driver of biodiversity decline by the mid-21st century.

4. Researchers from UNEP-WCMC have [conducted](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/researchers-call-for-consistent-monitoring-of-commitments-to-nature-as-analysis-reveals-national-reporting-shortfalls) the [first high-level analysis of countries' policy pledges for nature and subsequent reporting of actions taken under the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi biodiversity targets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44185-024-00039-5.epdf). They discovered that 44% of traceable commitments from national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) could not be linked to evidence of actions taken in their follow-up progress reports. At the end of the Decade on Biodiversity, it became clear that there were major shortfalls and the world had largely failed to achieve the global targets. To ensure accountable action for nature, policymakers need to know where, how and why previous commitments did not succeed. National reports do not always follow the same format as the NBSAPs, making simple summaries of progress challenging. To overcome this, the research team cross-referenced the NBSAPs against those countries' sixth national reports. After sorting and classifying commitments according to the Aichi Targets that they would contribute to, they found 7,931 traceable commitments, 56% of which were identifiable in a national report. Three-quarters of those traceable pledges were listed as having some level of success, however, 44% of previous global commitments were apparently not being tracked.  

5. [Launch of the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024: New data, trends, threats and possible solutions to combat illegal wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/launch-of-world-wildlife-crime-report-2024). The [report](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/wildlife.html) presents a systematic analysis of wildlife crime harms and impacts, probes the factors driving wildlife trafficking trends, and takes stock of current knowledge about the effectiveness of the different types of interventions being pursued to resolve wildlife crime. 

6. [Global report on food crises is a wake-up call](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/global-report-on-food-crises-is-a-wake-up-call/en). The [report](https://www.fsinplatform.org/global-report-food-crises-2024) shows that food crises are becoming increasingly protracted and underscored the risk that 'hard-won development gains are being reversed'. The report found that 282 million people in 59 countries and territories needed urgent action to reduce the food consumption gap, and 36 million people are in the IPC Phase 4, which is defined as Emergency, and require urgent action. 36 Countries have featured in this report for the past 8 years, highlighting the difficulty of restoring food security once its absence becomes acute.

7. [Are rare species more common than common species and is there a universal shape to the distribution of species abundance?](https://www.gbif.org/data-use/eicNfKNgbTHiIveqMpjA1/are-rare-species-more-common-than-common-species) To explore these questions, researchers downloaded all GBIF-mediated species occurrence data from 1880 to 2020, and [analysed global species abundance distributions for 39 classes of eukaryotes and prepared visualisations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02173-y) that show the number of species within abundance categories, ranging from single individuals to millions of individuals. Improved sampling and greater availability of data over time unveiled that by 2000, the distribution of bird species abundances was nearly perfectly bell-shaped and symmetrical, with most species having intermediate abundances. Among other taxa, such as amphibians and ray-finned fishes, the distributions were not fully uncovered, but exhibited similar patterns of unveiling over time, moving towards a bell-shaped, unimodal distribution.

8. [Populations of migratory freshwater fish species, including salmon, trout, eel and sturgeon, continue to decline](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/staggering-collapse-in-migratory-fish-populations-threatens-health-of-millions-and-critical-freshwater-ecosystems), risking the food security and livelihoods of millions of people, the survival of countless other species and the health and resilience of rivers, lakes and wetlands. The new [Living Planet Index report](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/2024-living-planet-index-update-for-migratory-freshwater-fishes) on freshwater migratory fishes reveals a staggering 81% collapse in monitored population sizes on average between 1970 to 2020, including catastrophic declines of 91% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 75% in Europe.

9. FAO [launched](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-action-plan-launched-for-implementing-fao-strategy-mainstreaming-biodiversity-across-agricultural-sectors-as-biodiversityrelated-projects-approved/en) its [2024-27 Action Plan](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd0709en) for the implementation of the FAO Strategy on Mainstreaming Biodiversity Across Agricultural Sectors, with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biodiversity, to promote sustainable agricultural practices and to conserve, enhance, preserve and restore biodiversity as a whole. The action plan sets out a wide range of deliverables including support for countries in the implementation and monitoring of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

10. A [new report outlines the progress of the first eight countries participating in the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network Initiative](https://www.besnet.world/navigating-towards-a-nature-positive-future/), Cameroon, Colombia, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Viet Nam, a collaborative initiative aimed at translating insights from global, regional and national biodiversity assessments into actionable measures for sustainable ecosystem management. By enhancing their science-policy synergies, these countries have made significant strides in policy alignment, governance strengthening, multi-stakeholder collaboration, ecosystem restoration, sustainable resource management and community livelihood enhancement.

**Climate**
1. Race to Resilience in action: [Replacing degraded land in Suriname with sustainable coconut farms](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-in-action-replacing-degraded-land-in-suriname-with-sustainable-coconut-farms/?_gl=1*r7w7kk*_ga*NDA5MTg0NDcyLjE3MDk1NjU5MTU.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTcxNjk5MDAyMy4yLjEuMTcxNjk5MDE3NC4wLjAuMA..) by planting a coconut tree seeling nursery and planting hardwood trees across a sprawling 1,200-hectare farm leased from the Surinamese government.

2. [Revitalised landscapes damaged by intense agriculture in Brazil's Paraná State](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/revitalizing-landscapes-damaged-by-intensive-agriculture-in-brazils-parana-state/). This project will restore 1,400 hectares of degraded land, impacting the local ecosystem positively and providing about 300 jobs in the area, enhancing living conditions and boosting local economies. 

3. Forests play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. To manage and protect forests, information on where forests are gaining or losing carbon are needed. Global Forest Watch [released](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/whats-new-carbon-flux-monitoring/) maps and associated statistics of forest greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration (forest carbon removals) and net greenhouse gas flux in 2021 based on a geospatial framework designed to be improved over time as relevant new data and information are produced. 


**Oceans**
1. OBIS and GBIF have [agreed](https://www.obis.org/2024/04/28/obis-gbif-partnership-ren/) to a [joint strategy](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-kcqs-5h52) and [action plan](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-e52v-5875) to deepen their collaboration, improve the flows and services of high-quality data about marine and coastal biodiversity and support research and decision-making on the world's oceans. More information about the strategy and action plan and involvement will be shared during 2 joint webinars on the 13th of June 2024: [07:00 UTC for Asia, Africa and Europe](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_MGK5uCxcRG2dyHoOeul8iQ) and [21:00 UTC for the Americas](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_JAyHic4xS1yx-TKYHsfVMg).

2. [Inspiring collaborative ocean action on a global scale: Ocean Decade launches new online training course on co-design](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-launches-new-online-course-on-co-design/). The course aims to equip participants with a fundamental understanding and knowledge of co-design methodologies for the implementation of current Decade Actions and development of Decade Action proposals. The training will build ocean stakeholders' practical skills for effective leadership in co-design processes and contribute to collaborative ocean research and policymaking. The 18-hour course is self-paced and free for everyone to [join](https://bit.ly/codesign-oceandecade). 

3. Coral reefs support a wide range of marine life, providing habitat, shelter and breeding grounds for many species of fish, invertebrates, and plants. Coral reefs are natural barriers that protect coastlines from erosion and storms and are vital to the economies of many coastal communities. They often support commercial fisheries, tourism, and shoreline protection activities. Additionally, they play a role in the global carbon cycle: coral polyps extract calcium carbonate from seawater to build their skeletons, which in turn removes carbon dioxide from the water. Pollution, overfishing and coastal development are some of the major threats to coral reefs, which in turn destabilise marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Rising sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching and eventual coral mortality, and ocean acidification and deoxygenation also damage coral reefs. [Copernicus Marine and Coral Guardian have joined forces to conserve coral reefs and promote marine sustainability](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-and-coral-guardian-partner-conserve-coral-reefs). Additionally, the [Coral Reef Breakthrough](https://racetozero.unfccc.int/system/coral-reef-breakthrough/) was [established](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-global-coalition-forging-coral-reef-resilience/) to provide targets and action points for collective action, including stopping drivers of loss, doubling the area of coral reefs under effective protection, accelerating restoration efforts and securing $12 billion USD from public and private sources by 2030 to conserve and restore at least 50% of remaining coral reef ecosystems.

4. [NCEAS' Arctic Data Center and partners tackle much-needed observation of permafrost thaw across the global Arctic region](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/sinking-soil-rising-research). Permafrost, earth that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, is the foundation of much of the global Arctic region. Thaw of ice-rich permafrost causes the ground to subside, slump, or crack. Permafrost thaw is an ecological and societal problem so complex that no single institution or government can address it alone. In 2019, the Arctic Data Center (ADC) and several other institutions analysed data from 175,000 satellite images to create the first snapshot of permafrost across the entire Arctic. Now, with a recently received $5 million grant, the team seeks to track thaw in near real-time by analysing other available data multiple times a year. 

5. [Call for new members of the Global Observing Oceanographic System Biology and Ecosystems Expert Panel](https://goosocean.org/news/call-for-new-members-of-the-goos-biology-and-ecosystems-expert-panel/) with an expertise in zooplankton ecology, hard coral reefs, continental shelf benthic invertebrate  ecology, macroalgal ecology, sea turtle ecology, seagrass observations and assessments, marine mammal ecology, ocean sound in relation to quantifying anthropogenic sound and pressures on marine fauna, and marine microbial ecology. Members will be expected to voluntarily commit roughly 12 days per year, including meeting with the Panel four times a year (mostly virtually).

### Issue 2
Date: 18 April 2024

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The [annual tree cover loss data for 2023](https://research.wri.org/gfr/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends) has been released. Brazil and Colombia experienced a remarkable 36% and 49% decrease in primary forest loss, respectively. However, the rate of tropical primary forest loss in 2023 remained consistent with recent years, with sharp increases in Bolivia, Laos, and Nicaragua. The total tropical primary forest loss totaled 3.7 million hectares, the equivalent of almost 10 football fields per minute. 

2. All over the world, efforts are ongoing to [protect, sustainably manage and restore areas of forest](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/forest-restoration-in-action-celebrating-pledges-to-inspire-society). Countries have promised to restore 1 billion hectares of land by 2030 as part of international climate, nature and land goals. Some of these initiatives are famous, covering tens of thousands of hectares and winning awards, such as the Desa'a Forest project in Ethiopia, part of the Great Green Wall programme to restore ecosystems across northern Africa. But most, particularly those carried out by non-state organisations and individuals, do not receive the same fanfare and often take place without formal recognition and acknowledgement. The UN Environment Programme World Conservation and Monitoring Centre works to make sure the contributions of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, private landowners, non-government organisations, and local administrations such as cities and businesses are recorded and celebrated on its [Nature Commitments platform](https://naturecommitments.org/). The website showcases more than 200 area-based conservation pledges, several of which are forest restoration initiatives.

3. A [survey on the value of ecosystem services provided by vultures in Southern Africa](https://survey.alchemer.eu/s3/90666696/Vulture-Valuation-International-Survey) has been developed by BirdLife International. The survey takes 5 - 10 minutes and has the purpose to understand the value that people place on vulture conservation. 

4. [Robust Indigenous and local land rights are vital](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/returning-to-the-wisdom-of-our-ancestors/) for managing forests, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving biodiversity and improving livelihoods. Climate Champions held [an interview](https://youtu.be/u6J-M2ttY1Q) with the executive director of Tenure Facility. As part of her work, Nonette Royo has helped to map and protect millions of hectares of land, and offers grants and technical assistance directly to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. A [recent report](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/11/indigenous-people-get-less-than-1-of-climate-funding-its-actually-worse-commentary/) showed that 0.13% of climate funding has actually been reaching Indigenous Peoples and Local communities for tenure and forest management. However, research over the last 5 years shows that deforestation rates are three to four times lower in territories with secure tenure, showing that ownership is key to conserving what we have and restoring what we have lost.

**Climate**
1. Women, gender-diverse individuals and marginalised communities often bear the brunt of the impact of climate change, while they have the least resources to adapt and are often responsible for securing food and water for their families. [Scale for Resilience seeks to empower women to become agents of change in building climate resilience within their communities](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/revolutionizing-resilience-through-womens-impact-in-climate-smart-finance/). The initiative, Female leadership for the transition towards regenerative economies, is a part of the overarching goal to make 3 million vulnerable populations more resilient by 2030 by facilitating access to finance for increased resilience along the financial value chain. 

2. Freshwater, the livelihood of ecosystems and societies, is under threat from the increasing impacts of climate change, one of which is salinisation. The increasing salinity of water and soil not only poses a challenge to agricultural productivity but also to the communities that live and work on the land. For Egypt's Nile Delta, a critical area for the country's agriculture and home to a quarter of its population, the impacts of climate change pose significant risks to farming, livelihoods and the national economy. As sea levels rise, low-lying areas, especially those in the Nile Delta region, are at risk of flooding, preventing the natural flushing of salts from the soil, leading to build up over time. An [initiative to maintain healthy and abundant yields and adapt to soil and water salinity is underway](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/salt-resistant-crops-and-the-race-to-secure-the-resilience-of-smallholder-farmers-in-egypts-nile-delta/) to help build salt-resilient crops, such as wheat, bare barley, common barley, corn, millet and maize, and through the restoration of degraded agricultural land. 

3. [Key climate action themes for 2024](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/where-are-we-and-where-are-we-going-next-key-climate-action-themes-for-2024/). In the COP28 outcome governments explicitly stated that we must transition away from fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner. It also underscored the importance of the global goal on adaptation in strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, as well as the vital importance of protecting and restoring nature, by 2030. According to Climate Analytics, an estimated 8 trillion USD investment is needed to deliver on the COP28 pledge to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030, compared to an expected 6 trillion USD in fossil fuels investments this decade. With the next generation of NDCs due by the first quarter of 2025, 2024 is a crucial year to act on the Global Stocktake outcome in COP28 and ensure that all sectors of the economy and all levels of society have a stake in enhancing national climate implementation plans.

4. Over one billion people worldwide currently live in self-built homes in informal urban settlements, outside of regulatory frameworks and without formal land tenure. These settlements often lack basic infrastructure such as sanitation, clean water and electricity, with residents also often facing the constant threat of eviction. The [Roof over our heads campaign](https://campaignforrooh.org/) is designed to [help women leaders from informal settlements to advance resilient, low carbon and affordable homes and solutions for their urban communities](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/from-invisible-and-informal-to-recognised-and-resilient-sheela-patel/) thereby advancing the overall climate resilience of their cities. 

5. [Johannesburg is currently confronting an unprecedented water crisis](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/inspiring-a-whole-of-society-mindset-shift-on-water), affecting those living in informal settlements as well as those in more affluent suburbs. In recent weeks, thousands of people in South Africa's largest city and economic hub have had to line up to collect water delivered by municipal tanker trucks, with taps running dry as a heatwave and crumbling infrastructure deplete the city's reservoirs. Among the climate impacts South Africa will likely face a decrease in rainfall. Water stress is a priority problem across the country, caused by excessive use, growing demand, pollution, inadequate infrastructure, poor practices and unequal access to water. Adding to these problems is climate change. Without a fundamental shift in the way South Africa thinks about water and a massive USD 60 billion investment, the country [will run out of water by 2030](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/partner-content-south-africa-danger-of-running-out-of-water).

6. The recently published [2024 temperature change statistics update](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1679824/) covers the period 1961 - 2023 for 198 countries and 39 territories. It provides country-level information on observed temperature change trends on land, as a basis to help identify risk and design the responses necessary to safeguard the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. The Paris Agreement limit of  1.5°C was surpassed in all regions in 2023, except in Oceania (0.9°C), with the largest temperature increase recorded in Europe (2.4°C), and the last 9 years were the nine warmest years on record.  

**Oceans**
1. [5.7 million euro BioEcoOcean Project will contribute to GOOS Essential Ocean Variables](https://goosocean.org/news/5-7-million-euro-bioecoocean-project-will-contribute-to-goos-essential-ocean-variables/). A new EU-funded project will provide a step change in how we observe the ocean to improve biodiversity and climate assessments. With a focus on fostering collaboration, advancing technology, and adhering to FAIR data principles, BioEcoOcean aims to bring about a systemic change in the way we understand and monitor the ocean. A key outcome of the project will be a Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science.

2. [UNEP-WCMC marine experts progress working definition of 'destructive fishing' to enable more sustainable and equitable practices](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-marine-experts-progress-working-definition-of-destructive-fishing-to-enable-more-sustainable-and-equitable-practices). Many policies and international frameworks recognise the need to end destructive fishing practices to conserve marine resources, protect the ocean and ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet. However, despite its widespread use, 'destructive fishing' is currently undefined and therefore immeasurable. The working definition, which will meaningfully support countries to monitor and reduce destructive fishing practices, is: 'destructive fishing is any fishing practice that causes irrecoverable habitat degradation, or which causes significant adverse environmental impacts, results in long-term declines in target or non-target species beyond biologically safe limits and has negative livelihood impacts'. Now that a starting definition has been proposed, the ambition of the project team is to work with stakeholders to further develop a consensus-built definition of 'destructive fishing' and encourage its adoption.

3. Pioneering [open access to unprecedented amounts of ecology data from an offshore wind farm](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/pioneering-open-access-to-unprecedented-amounts-of-ecology-data-from-offshore-wind-farm), which aims to be the most ecological wind farm, on the Dutch coast, to date with numerous ecological innovations. The winning bid focuses on innovative ecology measures and has a strong emphasis on data sharing and transparency. Through sharing data on the Ocean Data Platform, Ecowende, is contributing to a deeper understanding of the complexities inherent in our oceans - which is important as the North Sea is overexploited and largely unmapped. The data provided will come from numerous sensors in its offshore installations and stand-alone surveys. These sensors monitor a variety of species and other oceanic parameters, both above and below the water, such as bird observations, bat presence, underwater telemetry and acoustic data.

4. ['Making Oceans Count II' Initiative to expand ocean asset metrics and data for a sustainable blue economy](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/making-oceans-count-nbspinitiative-to-expand-ocean-asset-metrics-and-data-for-a-sustainable-blue-economy). The Making Oceans Count II will develop much-needed indicators and metrics for measuring impacts and dependencies from human activities on nature. Ocean assets metrics are parameters or measurements used to assess the health, productivity, and sustainability of ocean resources. With a primary focus on Denmark and the Nordics, the program is poised to generate insights with global relevance for a well-supported, sustainable blue economy, but initially focussing on further enhancing metrics related to the shipping industry, then broadening its scope to include offshore renewable energy as another critical sector.

5. An average of 85% of people polled worldwide believe a [soon-to-be concluded global plastic pollution treaty should ban single-use plastics](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/85-of-people-want-global-ban-on-single-use-plastics) that now account for more than 70% of ocean plastic pollution, according to a survey of more than 24,000 people in 32 countries commissioned by WWF and the Plastic Free Foundation. Other highly favoured bans include those on harmful chemicals used in plastic (which 90% supported) and plastic products that cannot be easily and safely recycled in the countries where they are used (87%). 

6. [Call for tender: Coastal and Arctic Hub Uptake](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/call-tender-coastal-arctic-hub-uptake), with a focus on improving their usability to attract new users. Applicants are invited to develop downstream applications or services that are linked to the Coastal or Arctic Hub and aligned with their specific themes (e.g. climate change); use products from Copernicus Marine Service and at least one other Copernicus Service; and emphasise the integration and adaptation of Copernicus products. Six products will be selected and each project will receive €100,000 in funding. The call is open until 26 April 2024. 

7. The [EU Copernicus Ocean State Report has been recognised as an action under the Mission 'Restore our Ocean and Waters' charter](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/ocean-state-report-recognised-under-eu-mission-restore-our-ocean-and-waters-charter). This recognition underscores the importance of the Copernicus Marine Service in achieving the objectives of the Mission Ocean and Waters initiative. It also highlights the importance of the [Ocean State Report](https://sp.copernicus.org/articles/1-osr7/index.html) as a valuable document for scientists, members of the blue economy, decision makers, and the public, providing a comprehensive overview on the state of the ocean. 

8. Global Fishing Watch has announced [three pioneering collaborations](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/our-ocean-conference-global-fishing-watch-international-partnerships-enhance-ocean-management/) with Greece, Panama and the West African Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission in a bid to harness technology and data-driven solutions for enhanced transparency, improved fisheries management and greater ocean sustainability. The partnership will leverage open data to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, promote sustainable fisheries management and enable marine protection through deepened engagement with governmental bodies spanning three continents. In addition, they will provide Global Fishing Watch the opportunity to highlight transparency as a critical marine management tool and advance policy reforms regarding the adoption of vessel tracking methods like automatic identification systems and vessel monitoring systems, as well as regional data sharing practices.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. On the 23rd March WWF's Earth Hour was held. This year, [WWF encourages individuals to 'Give an hour for earth'](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/earth-hour-2024-give-an-hour-for-earth) by spending 60 minutes participating in any eco-positive activity from now until Earth Day on the 22nd of April. There is an [online interactive tool](http://wwf.earth/hour) that suggests activities for various lifestyles and interests, and participants can log their contribution to the national and global 'Hour Bank'.

2. [Out of the woodlands: innovating satellite data use in Asia-Pacific biodiversity conservation](https://www.planet.com/pulse/out-of-the-woodlands-innovating-satellite-data-use-in-asia-pacific-biodiversity-conservation/). The International Day of Forests is observed for people to work together to ensure forests are part of any future climate change strategies. This year, Asia-Pacific's lush forests and deep dive into satellite data's role in preserving these natural carbon sinks were highlighted to raise awareness. Satellite data has emerged as a game-changer in the field of forestry management and conservation. Data was used for internal monitoring and categorising them into rehabilitation, conservation, or protection status. The images served as an external communications medium to communities benefiting from the project. 

3. A [digital milestone in wildlife conservation, CITES-LEX](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-lex-launched-2024), has been launched. [CITES-LEX](https://citeslex.fao.org/) is designed to assist Parties to the CITES of Wild Fauna and Flora to navigate the complexities of international trade in species listed in the CITES Appendices by providing comprehensive access to national catalogues and legislative policies. This multilateral agreement aims to ensure that international trade does not threaten the survival of these species.

4. Wildland fires threaten communities and landscapes as climate change continues to drive increased heat and drought intensity. [Recent studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.825190/full) have confirmed that forest fires today burn roughly twice as much tree cover as they did two decades ago, with monumental costs in damage to infrastructure, property, natural resources and response operations. The moisture contained in living vegetation, live fuel moisture, is a strong indicator of wildfire risk. In many wildfire-prone areas, government employees regularly collect vegetation samples from specific locations to understand how quickly fuels will burn. However, field studies can be difficult to regularly perform at the landscape scale, especially in remote regions. Studies show that soil water content is a leading indicator of live fuel moisture; when soils are drier than normal, vegetation is more likely to burn. With novel remote sensing techniques, vegetation dryness and wildfire risk can be measured over large areas at a higher frequency than before. [Planet Soil Water Content](https://content.planet.com/c/planet-datasheet-soi-2?x=AmSTOq&_gl=1*1kqbd0p*_gcl_au*MTY4Njk5MzM5Ni4xNzEwMTczMTQy) data, derived from satellite sensors, is strongly correlated with ground measurements of soil moisture, and can be used as an input in wildfire risk models. There are two on-demand webinars developed by Planet: [Natural disaster management: monitoring wildfire risk and hazard fuels removal](https://learn.planet.com/Monitoring-Wildfire-Risk-and-Hazard-Fuels-Removal-Register.html?_gl=1*1tz9mgh*_gcl_au*MTYyNDI0ODYyMC4xNzEzMjcwMjQz) and [Planet data for multi-hazard risk mitigation in U.S. State and local government](https://learn.planet.com/Multi-Hazard-Risk-Mitigation-Registration.html?_gl=1*1tz9mgh*_gcl_au*MTYyNDI0ODYyMC4xNzEzMjcwMjQz).

5. An ocean matchmaking tool, called the '[Ocean Matcher](https://www.oceanmatcher.com/)', aims to tackle the funding challenge of the Ocean Decade, and to facilitate [smart matching between scientists and innovators on the one hand and philanthropists and investors on the other](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/the-funding-we-need-for-the-ocean-we-want-introducing-the-ocean-matcher). Leveraging algorithmic matching technology and a natural language model, Ocean Matcher will be a paradigm shift in the allocation of funding for the ocean, steering towards a healthier planet. So far, the feasibility study and Proof of Concept have produced positive results. The initiators and the project team aim to drive the development from the Proof of Concept to a live pilot, heading towards full scale launch when reaching organic product-market fit. 

6. [Planet Insights Platform delivers powerful tooling for unlocking earth observation data](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-insights-platform/). [Planet Insights Platform](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-insights-platform/) is the next milestone in Planet's journey to provide multidimensional Earth insights. The platform brings together new capabilities that improve customers' capacity to analyse and orchestrate large volumes of Earth data, reduce upfront development and maintenance costs, and focus on differentiation. The updates include a unified account experience across Planet and Sentinel hub, enhanced analysis-ready PlanetScope data (using proprietary AI to create harmonised, cloud-masked, and spatially consistent daily stack of images), updated global road and building change detection, new and improved Planetary variables and time series and statistical analysis. Users can build insights and solutions, make decisions, and act faster.

With the rapid spread of AI, these [recommendations](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/2b6cf7e5-36ac-41cb-aab5-0d32050143dc_en) address key opportunities and challenges. Building on the principles of research integrity, they offer guidance to researchers, research organisations, and research funders to ensure a coherent approach across Europe. The key takeaways from the guidelines include that researchers should refrain from using generative AI tools in sensitive activities such as peer reviews or evaluations and use generative AI respecting privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights; research organisations should facilitate the responsible use of generative AI and actively monitor how these tools are developed and used within their organisations; and funding organisations should support applicants in using generative AI transparently.

2. [eCITES receives Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum 2024 innovation award](https://cites.org/eng/news/ecites-receives-aptff-innovation-award-2024). Electronic CITES Permitting Systems ([eCITES](https://cites.org/eng/prog/eCITES)) have catalysed a novel set of collaborative efforts for enhancing trace facilitation and leveraging digitalisation for legal, sustainable, and traceable international wildlife trade. To date, 31 Parties have made considerable strides in implementing eCITES, with an additional 12 Parties in the initial planning phases. Their dedicated efforts have significantly bolstered transparency, curtailed the exploitation of counterfeit permits, facilitated smoother cross-border transactions, and fortified international collaboration.

3. [Advancing sustainable tourism and conservation in Seychelles' Vallée de Mai world heritage site amids adversity](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2670). The COVID-19 pandemic showed the vulnerability of tourism, leading to a drastic decline of over 70% in foreign visitors to Seychelles in 2020. Despite protecting 50% of its terrestrial expanse and 30% of its marine territories, Seychelles continues to face threats to its biodiversity and natural heritage. Climate change, invasive species, forest fires, biodiversity loss from developmental projects, as well as local poaching and illegal fishing activities, demand heightened attention and mitigation efforts. An initiative to enhance sustainable tourism management and conservation within the 'Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve" World Heritage Site, implemented in 2022 - 2023, involved robust statistical visitor management, optimisation of sales performance, and the development of scientific monitoring and visitor engagement applications. A web-based database was developed, providing integrated analysis of visitor metrics and biodiversity surveillance. To improve data acquisition and enrich visitor experiences within the site, a visitor science application was developed for self-guided tours and opportunistic species sighting data collection. This technological innovation not only enhanced visitor engagement but also facilitated the preservation of invaluable ecological data. The official launch of the app took place in February 2024.

4. The Scientific Advice Mechanism of the European Commission [released](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/commission-receives-scientific-advice-artificial-intelligence-uptake-research-and-innovation-2024-04-15_en) its independent policy [recommendations on how to facilitate the uptake of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2a6e3d4f-fae0-11ee-a251-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-315352732) in research and innovation across the EU. The advice is non-binding but may feed into the overall Commission strategy for AI in research and innovation. AI has the potential to revolutionise scientific discovery, accelerate research progress, boost innovation and improve researchers' productivity, and ultimately contribute to solving global societal challenges. On the other hand, it also presents obstacles and risks, for example with obtaining transparent, reproducible results that are essential to robust science in an open society. Furthermore the efficacy of many existing AI models is regarded as compromised by the quality of data used for their training.  

**Indices, indicators and variables**
1. [Planetary variables](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) are [analysis-ready data feeds that measure important conditions on the surface of the Earth](https://www.planet.com/pulse/measuring-earth-dynamics-with-planetary-variables/) including soil water content, land surface temperature, crop biomass, and forest structure and carbon. They draw on observations from numerous public and commercial satellite missions to generate datasets that have broad, continuous geographic coverage, high-temporal resolution, and a deep archive. The Planetary variables are rigorously tested and validated, and are designed to make Earth observation more accessible by reducing the need to build sophisticated data fusion and machine learning models that translate esoteric datasets into measurements of variables that matter. To analyse the Planetary variables, [Planet Insights Platform](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-insights-platform/) has been developed. It is a cloud-based and API-first platform, and enables performing planetary-scale analyses with multi-temporal statistical analysis of EO data and is designed to analyse deep archives of data.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. OpenAIRE is looking for a [subcontractor to support the implementation of the EOSC Track](https://www.openaire.eu/newsroom), which will develop and operate the European Open Science Observatory, a policy intelligence tool that will monitor policies, investments, digital research outputs, skills and infrastructure. The deadline for the Open Call is the 19th of April, 17:00 CET. The subcontractor is expected to start in May 2024, and finish in November 2027.

2. DataCite and ARDC announced a strategic partnership to deliver RAID, a [service and system to identify and track research projects and activities](https://datacite.org/blog/datacite-ardc-announce-partnership-to-deliver-the-raid-service/). RAID is designed to maintain consistent and up-to-date information on projects throughout the research lifecycle. It provides a unique, persistent identifier for each research project. As the project evolves, information about project personnel, organisations, inputs, and outputs is added to the RAID container, producing a project and capturing information about relationships between resourcing and outcomes.

3. The DataCite Metadata Working Group [has been working](https://datacite.org/blog/metadata-schema-rfc-march_2024/) on [MetaData Schema changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaxTKVO10BoRiBb_nOQY8mlFmhacUBvfk1LicYHnhOA), and are currently [requesting feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaxTKVO10BoRiBb_nOQY8mlFmhacUBvfk1LicYHnhOA). They are specifically looking for comments on languages and translators: making the Language property repeatable and recommended; documentation updates to clarify supported language codes; adding a new dataType Coverage; adding 2 new relatedIdentierTypes RRID and CSTR; adding a new contributorType Translator, adding 2 new relationTypes IsTranslationOf and HasTranslation and adding a new resourceTypeGeneral Project. The deadline for comments is the 6th of May, 2024.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Navigating transport of live animals and plants: CITES online workshop shares best practices, regulations and guidelines](https://cites.org/eng/news/transport-in-live-specimens-cites-online-workshop-2024). Transporting live animals and plants across borders for trade requires navigating a complex system of international regulations and meticulous logistics - from designing species-appropriate containers to taking safe biosecurity measures. To ensure effective regulatory compliance and sustainable transport practices, it is crucial to raise awareness among all stakeholders involved in the transport of live specimens on regulation updates, best practices, and emerging technologies.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Looking back at 2023: a review of the year of IUCN Save Our Species](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2023-our-year-in-review/). Together with the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, more than 20 new projects on species conservation frontlines are supported. The [IUCN Global Species ACtion Plan](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2023-029-En.pdf) was launched, providing a guide for countries to integrate species actions into their national biodiversity strategies and action plans. The introduction of the [latest iteration of the Global Tiger Recovery Progamme](https://globaltigerforum.org/global-tiger-recovery-program-2-0-2023-34/) marked a turning point as it engages key tiger stakeholders in a more targeted manner, both at a high policy level and on the ground. [SOS Lemurs will continue its work in Madagascar until 2029](https://iucnsos.org/sos-lemurs-will-continue-until-2029-thanks-to-9-5-million-chf-extension/), protecting both species and their habitats while also creating livelihood opportunities for the Malagasy people. The [third call for proposals for the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund initiative was held](https://iucnsos.org/third-calls-for-proposals-for-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-now-open-apply-now/), supporting the conservation of threatened freshwater species. The first global freshwater fish assessment carried out by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species showed that 25% of the world's freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction, with 17% of them affected by climate change.

2. The Theme of the World Wildlife Day 2024, on the 3rd of March 2024, was [connecting people and planet: exploring digital innovation in wildlife conservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4J42sAF48&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcites.org%2Feng%2Fnode%2F139499&feature=emb_imp_woyt). Information and communication technologies became powerful instruments for tackling illegal wildlife trade and supporting conservation. UNEP-WCMC designed and maintains the [Species+ website](https://speciesplus.net/) and mobile app, with up-to-date information on the locations, protections and restrictions attached to wildlife listed by CITES and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. On the 3rd of March, UNEP-WCMC launched the [NDF Support Tool](https://ndfsupport.unep-wcmc.org/en), non-detriment findings (NDFs), which science-based decisions about whether international trade in CITES listed-species is detrimental or not, and links together globally important databases on CITES information and endangered species, to help country authorities to conduct the crucial sustainability assessments needed to justify trade in species.

3. [Who pays for conservation? New CITES publication calls for mobilising sustainable finance for African elephants conservation](https://cites.org/eng/mobilizing-sustainable-finance-for-african-elephant-conservation-2023-publication). The African elephant is revered as the largest land mammals and a globally iconic species. However, securing consistent, long-term funding for its conservation within its natural habitats and fostering harmonious cohabitation with humans remains elusive. The financial support required remains largely inadequate, with substantial challenges such as human-elephant conflict, habitat loss, poaching and illegal trade. In a new CITES report, [Mobilising sustainable finance for African elephant conservation](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/prog/elephant/ENGmobilizingSustainableFinanceForAfricanElephantConservation.pdf), various financial mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits, green bonds, wildlife bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, and Conservation Trust Funds to assess their applicability towards African elephant conservation were reviewed.

4. The [14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-at-cop14-supporting-species-recovery-to-achieve-global-biodiversity-goals/) (CMS COP14) took place from February 11 - 17, in Uzbekistan. During the opening of the COP, the first-ever [State of the World's Migratory Species report](https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species) was [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/landmark-un-report-reveals-shocking-decline-in-worlds-migratory-animal-populations) as part of the latest global conference of Parties to the UN Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The report reveals that while some migratory species are improving, 44% are showing population declines, and 22% of CMS-listed species are threatened with extinction. 97% of CMS-listed fish are threatened with extinction. 58% of the monitored sites recognised as being important for CMS-listed species are experiencing unsustainable levels of human-caused pressure, and the 2 greatest threats to both CMS-listed and all migratory species are overexploitation and habitat loss due to human activity. [Collisions with power lines](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/5-surprising-obstacles-to-migratory-animals-journeys) are a threat to migratory birds and bats, as they risk electrocutions, but the power lines also act as a barrier by changing migratory behaviour and flight paths, as some species avoid straight lines.
To protect threatened carnivores, IUCN and the CMS Secretariat [signed a memorandum](https://www.iucn.org/news/202402/iucn-and-convention-migratory-species-secretariat-sign-agreement-mobilize-funds-and) of understanding to raise conservation funds and facilitate the implementation of the African Carnivore Initiative for key carnivore species in Africa: lions, cheetahs, leopards and African wild dogs.  

5.  The [2nd Tiger Programme Workshop](https://iucnsos.org/driving-tiger-conservation-insights-from-the-2nd-tiger-programme-workshop-in-bangkok/) was held in Bangkok, Thailand, to facilitate knowledge sharing and disseminate best practices among our esteemed partners and grantees. Among the participants were representatives and project managers from 14 distinguished organisations spanning tiger range countries and representatives of various IUCN Country offices. Many participants expressed a desire for more frequent workshops and online learning sessions to maintain momentum and expand knowledge sharing.

6. Fondation Segré and IUCN Save Our Species announced the [fourth calls for proposals to protect threatened ungulates](https://iucnsos.org/new-funding-to-protect-threatened-ungulates-now-possible-under-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-apply-now/). Ungulates contribute significantly to maintaining the health and resilience of our ecosystems, support seed dispersal and germination, and are critical prey species that support the survival of carnivore and scavenger wildlife species. However, poaching, habitat loss and disease threaten the survival of many of these species. The first call for proposals is for conservation action grants: to enable and support civil society organisations engaged in the conservation of globally threatened ungulate species to carry out sustainable conservation measures at local level to protect the species, their habitats and to improve the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. The second is a research support grant to support young and early career scientists in their research to improve knowledge of globally threatened ungulate species and their role in natural ecosystems.

7. [Differences between Global Forest Watch's tree cover loss data and JRC's tropical moist forest data explained](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/tree-cover-loss-and-tropical-moist-forest-data-compared/). The [annual tree cover loss data](https://gfw.global/3BfwQWz) maps forests globally based on tree cover extent in 2000. Tree cover is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum height of at least 5 metres at 30-metre resolution, which includes all types of tree cover. The Global Forest Watch map shows tree cover with a 30% canopy density. The JRC data set includes all closed primary and secondary forests in the humid tropics and does not apply a minimum height or canopy density threshold to delineate forest extent.

8. [New agreement to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence associated with international wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-woah-memorandum-of-understanding-2024-zoonotic-disease-emergence). The growing list of emerging zoonoses, emerging diseases that spillover from wildlife to humans, led CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to review the intricate relationship between international wildlife trade and zoonotic diseases, and to discuss the role of the Convention in reducing the risk of future zoonotic disease emergence associated with CITES trade.

9. In ground-breaking research [published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8028), scientists at the UN Environmental Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, [reveal the global distribution of more than 35,000 plant species used by people](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/plants-and-their-contributions-to-people-are-insufficiently-protected-globally). Analysis of the first-ever global map of the diversity and rarity of plant species with documented uses by people has found that the highest concentrations of utilised plants are in the Tropics, and that regions with high concentrations of utilised plant species are largely unprotected.

10. Biodiversity data collection is growing, driven in part by international commitments to conservation, market investments and technological advances and the growing urgency of human impacts including climate change. Nations increasingly rely on biodiversity data in order to strategically meet global conservation targets for the coming decades. But not all data is collected equally. A recent [Science publication](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh8874) shows that biodiversity data is increasingly concentrated in wealthy countries. The authors argue that this context should be unearthed to [prevent inequitable implementation of conservation species](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/unpacking-social-equity-biodiversity-data).

11. [GBIF crossed the significant milestone of logging the 10,000th peer-reviewed journal article using and citing data shared through its network](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data). The [10,000th paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2023.2291133) explores the effects of climate change on rhinoceros populations in Southern Africa, and species occurrence records from the GBIF network to model the future distributions of critically endangered black rhinoceros populations and near threatened white rhinoceros populations in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Botswana, Zambia and Tanzania was used. 

12. [Ending deforestation from cocoa in West Africa with new data-driven resources](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/data-resources-ending-deforestation-cocoa-west-africa/). The global demand for chocolate has had a significant impact on West African forests. Approximately 70% of the global supply of cocoa originates from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, where production sites have replaced millions of hectares of forest. Between 2001 and 2015, cocoa was linked to the loss of a third of Ghana's forest area and a quarter of Côte d’Ivoire's. In 2017, the [Cocoa & Forests Initiative](https://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/initiative/cocoa-forests-initiative/) (CFI) was established in an effort to end cocoa-driven deforestation and restore forest areas. Companies that joined the CFI agreed to map their supply chains, align methodologies on deforestation risk assessment and contribute to transparent monitoring and reporting.

13. Following the first case of Avian Influenza in the Galápagos, which was detected in September 2023 and already caused the death of thousands of birds on the South American mainland and also affected mammals as otters, dolphins and sea lions, the Rapid Response Facility, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre and Fauna and Flora joint initiative has provided 40,000 USD to [support active surveillance of seabird populations](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2668), aiming to understand the extent and limit the spread of the potentially devastating virus. Surveys will be carried out at key breeding colonies of Galápagos penguin, albatross and flightless cormorant populations, and collected samples will be analysed for the identification of Avian Influenza. Findings will be shared with the Galápagos National Park Directorate, to inform management interventions, such as potential tourist restrictions and appropriate quarantine measures for specific areas.

**Climate**
1. The Copernicus Climate Change Service showed that the [global mean temperature from February 2023 to January 2024 was the highest on record](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-january-2024), the whole year was above the 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and the average global sea surface temperature for January reached a temperature of 20.97°C, which is the warmest January on record and the second warmest month, which was August 2023. 

2. [A roots up approach to protecting and restoring our natural capital for the good of people and planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-roots-up-approach-to-protecting-and-restoring-our-natural-capital-people-and-planet/). The world's largest land [conference](https://www.acceleratingnbsconference.org/about-1) took place in Zambia from 11 - 15 March 2024 and brought together a range of voices from the climate community to collaborate on advancing nature-based solutions as a critical part of global climate action. 

3. Aviva, a member of the Finance Sector Deforestation Action (FSDA) and Race to Zero explains why [ending deforestation is a prerequisite for both reversing biodiversity loss and meeting net zero targets](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/aviva-achieving-net-zero-by-addressing-deforestation/). Together with 30 other leading financial institutes that are members of the FSDA, have committed to use their best efforts to eliminate agriculture commodity-driven deforestation in their portfolios by 2025.

4. Climate change around Mount Kilimanjaro is real and has affected local communities. UNESCO and the Kilimanjaro National Park authority have implemented a project titled 'Empowering young women and men for [adaptation to climate change at the Kilimanjaro National Park World Heritage site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2665)'. Through the project, scientific data and traditional knowledge on impacts of climate change were collected. Some key findings included provision of conservation education awareness on climate change, strengthening conservation of forests and discouraging farming to water sources. 

5. [The green bond market, currently at 4 trillion USD, needs to expand tenfold to meet the urgent demands of climate action](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/sean-kidney-the-green-bond-market-needs-to-expand-tenfold-to-meet-the-urgent-demands-of-climate-action/). From a modest beginning of 1.5 billion USD, 15 years ago, the market for green, social, and sustainable bonds has exploded to 4 trillion USD today. One significant hurdle for the transition to greener practices is the confusion about actionable steps, compounded by misinformation, such as the underestimated impact of methane leakage from the gas industry, which has muddled energy investment strategies. 

**Oceans**
1. European scientists have [identified and published 100 crucial questions to advance seagrass conservation and restoration efforts in Europe](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10486), and aim to [fill knowledge gaps and prioritise research](https://goosocean.org/news/scientists-point-the-way-to-enhance-conservation-and-restoration-of-essential-marine-life/) to combat climate change and biodiversity loss in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses play a vital role in our oceans by storing carbon in the seabed, enhancing biodiversity, filtering water, and preventing coastal erosion. However, seagrasses have faced widespread decline worldwide, prompting the need for intensified conservation and restoration efforts.

2. In the case of increasing anthropogenic threats to ecosystems and livelihoods, such as marine pollution, climate change events, and over-exploitation of ocean resources, reshaping our connection with the ocean at all scales and across all of society has become imperative. Through its [Challenge 10: 'Change Humanity's Relationship with the Ocean'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzaPG-cqj3Q), the UN Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (the 'Ocean Decade') aims to [encourage behavioural changes and ensure the impact of solutions in improving humanity's relationship with the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/vision-2030-wg10-redefines-humanitys-relationship-with-the-ocean/).

3. [Maturing the Ocean Enterprise: dialogues with Industry Roadmap unveiled](https://goosocean.org/news/maturing-the-ocean-enterprise-dialogues-with-industry-roadmap-unveiled/), a result of the groundbreaking collaboration involving the Global Ocean Observing System, the Marine Technology Society, The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration and industry representatives. 

4. [Introducing new and improved annual turbidity datasets](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/introducing-annual-turbidity-datasets/). When changes of water quality can be observed visually, such as when the azure waters of a tropical region are engulfed by muddy sediment, this type of measurement of water quality is referred to as 'turbidity'. Turbidity can often indicate places and times when land is overly impacting reefs, and monitoring ocean turbidity in the vicinity of coral reefs has become an important, and still growing, challenge for reef conservationists, managers and scientists. Satellite data was retrospectively analysed, so that long-term average trends can be monitored, identifying chronic turbidity. 

5. [HUB Ocean and WWF partner on data-driven solutions](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/hub-ocean-and-wwf-partner-on-data-solutions-for-ocean-healthnbsp) to current and future risks for the blue economy at the intersection of nature and climate. The partnership will accelerate current and future big data and AI-powered products targeting governments, the private sector, and scientific research benefiting people and nature.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Race to resilience partner initiative wins World Habitat Award for early warning tool](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-partner-initiatve-wins-world-habitat-award-for-early-warning-tool/). People living in informal urban settlements are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, like storms, floods and heatwaves. Yet, these communities are often unable to access weather information that could help save their lives or prevent devastating damage to their homes and livelihoods. The Developing Risk Awareness through Joint Action ([DARAJA](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/resurgence-unveils-daraja-africas-boldest-urban-early-warning-initiative/?)) is a weather forecasting and early warning system specifically for residents of informal settlements that operates in Kenya and Tanzania, and is currently being developed in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia.

[IHME, Microsoft, and Planet collaborate to map climate-vulnerable populations in unprecedented detail](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ihme-microsoft-and-planet-collaborate-to-map-climate-vulnerable-populations-in-unprecedented-detail/). Across the Global South, many cities and regions are growing much more rapidly than their citizens can be counted, leading to settlements that are much larger than their 'official' population counts. For example, Zinder, in Niger, was estimated to grow at more than 5% annually, but has nearly doubled in size since the last official census in 2012. Knowing in detail where people are located is essential to ensure effective humanitarian action when crises strike. 

3. [Planet, Microsoft and researchers build new AI-focused resource for environmental reporting](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-microsoft-and-researchers-build-new-ai-focused-resource-for-environmental-reporting/). In [accelerating biodiversity and ecosystem reporting](https://learn.planet.com/Microsoft-WhitePaper-Gated.html) readers are taken step-by-step through biodiversity and ecosystem reporting, from scoping to assessing and reporting. Concrete examples from industry and the scientific literature demonstrating how recent advances in EO, AI and ecosystem science can help deliver up-to-date and actionable insights for biodiversity and ecosystem metrics, from ecosystem conversion to the state of species.

4. A comprehensive pilot study aims to [globally map sand and dust storms hazards](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/SandDust), employing remote sensing data, advanced Geographic Information System analysis and cutting-edge software such as Google Earth Engine. The primary objective is to create a detailed hazard map, assessing the frequencies, intensities and trends of the sand and dust storm events worldwide. The study also delves into identifying key drivers behind the sand and dust storm events, including climate change, land cover transformations and overgrazing. 

5. Information on hundreds of territories and areas conserved by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, also known as ICCAs or territories of life, is now publicly available. The [ICCA Registry](https://www.iccaregistry.org/) is an [online reporting platform for strengthening evidence on the conservation importance of ICCAs](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/leading-database-on-conservation-by-indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-opens-to-public), alongside increasing global understanding and recognition of these vital areas and their custodians' conservation practices. ICCA custodians can submit a range of information to the ICCA Registry, including geographical data, photos and case studies, and explore how other communities around the world manage and conserve their territories and areas.

6. A [new study published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8) offers an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean and how it is changing. The study, led by Global Fishing Watch, uses machine learning and satellite imagery to create the [first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/new-research-harnesses-ai-and-satellite-imagery-to-reveal-the-expanding-footprint-of-human-activity-at-sea/), finding a remarkable amount of activity that was previously 'dark' to public monitoring systems. The analysis reveals that about 75% of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked. More than 25% of transport and energy vessel activity are also missing from public tracking systems. 

7. [GBIF has renewed its successful partnership with DataCamp Donates](https://www.gbif.org/news/yEwhAKzjLvyV7lFZzqqTj/continued-partnership-to-improve-data-literacy-for-gbif-users), enabling data users from across much of its network to access valuable training and improve their data skills. In the past year, 70 GBIF community members completed 115 courses through the learning platform together, covering topics such as programming, data manipulation, probability and statistics, data visualisation and machine learning.

8. [The Copernicus Marine Service launches the Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-ocean-climate-portal). The [Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/ocean-climate-portal) is an innovative platform designed to provide information about our oceans, with a user-friendly interface for accessing a range of ocean  indicators. This presents a significant step forward in our understanding of the impact of climate change on our oceans.

9. [BioEcoOcean - New Horizon EU project to co-create and test a globally applicable blueprint for integrated ocean science](https://www.obis.org/2024/03/13/bioecoocean-new-project/). This comprehensive blueprint will become a tool to guide ocean observing programs from the early planning stages, to data collection, to integrating results into policy and decision making. The blueprint will include data management aspects to facilitate standardisation of ocean observation data, and flow into global repositories like OBIS.
