### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Looking back at 2023: a review of the year of IUCN Save Our Species](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2023-our-year-in-review/). Together with the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, more than 20 new projects on species conservation frontlines are supported. The [IUCN Global Species ACtion Plan](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2023-029-En.pdf) was launched, providing a guide for countries to integrate species actions into their national biodiversity strategies and action plans. The introduction of the [latest iteration of the Global Tiger Recovery Progamme](https://globaltigerforum.org/global-tiger-recovery-program-2-0-2023-34/) marked a turning point as it engages key tiger stakeholders in a more targeted manner, both at a high policy level and on the ground. [SOS Lemurs will continue its work in Madagascar until 2029](https://iucnsos.org/sos-lemurs-will-continue-until-2029-thanks-to-9-5-million-chf-extension/), protecting both species and their habitats while also creating livelihood opportunities for the Malagasy people. The [third call for proposals for the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund initiative was held](https://iucnsos.org/third-calls-for-proposals-for-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-now-open-apply-now/), supporting the conservation of threatened freshwater species. The first global freshwater fish assessment carried out by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species showed that 25% of the world's freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction, with 17% of them affected by climate change.

2. The Theme of the World Wildlife Day 2024, on the 3rd of March 2024, was [connecting people and planet: exploring digital innovation in wildlife conservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4J42sAF48&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcites.org%2Feng%2Fnode%2F139499&feature=emb_imp_woyt). Information and communication technologies became powerful instruments for tackling illegal wildlife trade and supporting conservation. UNEP-WCMC designed and maintains the [Species+ website](https://speciesplus.net/) and mobile app, with up-to-date information on the locations, protections and restrictions attached to wildlife listed by CITES and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. On the 3rd of March, UNEP-WCMC launched the [NDF Support Tool](https://ndfsupport.unep-wcmc.org/en), non-detriment findings (NDFs), which science-based decisions about whether international trade in CITES listed-species is detrimental or not, and links together globally important databases on CITES information and endangered species, to help country authorities to conduct the crucial sustainability assessments needed to justify trade in species.

3. [Who pays for conservation? New CITES publication calls for mobilising sustainable finance for African elephants conservation](https://cites.org/eng/mobilizing-sustainable-finance-for-african-elephant-conservation-2023-publication). The African elephant is revered as the largest land mammals and a globally iconic species. However, securing consistent, long-term funding for its conservation within its natural habitats and fostering harmonious cohabitation with humans remains elusive. The financial support required remains largely inadequate, with substantial challenges such as human-elephant conflict, habitat loss, poaching and illegal trade. In a new CITES report, [Mobilising sustainable finance for African elephant conservation](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/prog/elephant/ENGmobilizingSustainableFinanceForAfricanElephantConservation.pdf), various financial mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits, green bonds, wildlife bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, and Conservation Trust Funds to assess their applicability towards African elephant conservation were reviewed.

4. The [14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-at-cop14-supporting-species-recovery-to-achieve-global-biodiversity-goals/) (CMS COP14) took place from February 11 - 17, in Uzbekistan. During the opening of the COP, the first-ever [State of the World's Migratory Species report](https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species) was [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/landmark-un-report-reveals-shocking-decline-in-worlds-migratory-animal-populations) as part of the latest global conference of Parties to the UN Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The report reveals that while some migratory species are improving, 44% are showing population declines, and 22% of CMS-listed species are threatened with extinction. 97% of CMS-listed fish are threatened with extinction. 58% of the monitored sites recognised as being important for CMS-listed species are experiencing unsustainable levels of human-caused pressure, and the 2 greatest threats to both CMS-listed and all migratory species are overexploitation and habitat loss due to human activity. [Collisions with power lines](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/5-surprising-obstacles-to-migratory-animals-journeys) are a threat to migratory birds and bats, as they risk electrocutions, but the power lines also act as a barrier by changing migratory behaviour and flight paths, as some species avoid straight lines.
To protect threatened carnivores, IUCN and the CMS Secretariat [signed a memorandum](https://www.iucn.org/news/202402/iucn-and-convention-migratory-species-secretariat-sign-agreement-mobilize-funds-and) of understanding to raise conservation funds and facilitate the implementation of the African Carnivore Initiative for key carnivore species in Africa: lions, cheetahs, leopards and African wild dogs.  

5.  The [2nd Tiger Programme Workshop](https://iucnsos.org/driving-tiger-conservation-insights-from-the-2nd-tiger-programme-workshop-in-bangkok/) was held in Bangkok, Thailand, to facilitate knowledge sharing and disseminate best practices among our esteemed partners and grantees. Among the participants were representatives and project managers from 14 distinguished organisations spanning tiger range countries and representatives of various IUCN Country offices. Many participants expressed a desire for more frequent workshops and online learning sessions to maintain momentum and expand knowledge sharing.

6. Fondation Segré and IUCN Save Our Species announced the [fourth calls for proposals to protect threatened ungulates](https://iucnsos.org/new-funding-to-protect-threatened-ungulates-now-possible-under-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-apply-now/). Ungulates contribute significantly to maintaining the health and resilience of our ecosystems, support seed dispersal and germination, and are critical prey species that support the survival of carnivore and scavenger wildlife species. However, poaching, habitat loss and disease threaten the survival of many of these species. The first call for proposals is for conservation action grants: to enable and support civil society organisations engaged in the conservation of globally threatened ungulate species to carry out sustainable conservation measures at local level to protect the species, their habitats and to improve the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. The second is a research support grant to support young and early career scientists in their research to improve knowledge of globally threatened ungulate species and their role in natural ecosystems.

7. [Differences between Global Forest Watch's tree cover loss data and JRC's tropical moist forest data explained](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/tree-cover-loss-and-tropical-moist-forest-data-compared/). The [annual tree cover loss data](https://gfw.global/3BfwQWz) maps forests globally based on tree cover extent in 2000. Tree cover is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum height of at least 5 metres at 30-metre resolution, which includes all types of tree cover. The Global Forest Watch map shows tree cover with a 30% canopy density. The JRC data set includes all closed primary and secondary forests in the humid tropics and does not apply a minimum height or canopy density threshold to delineate forest extent.

8. [New agreement to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence associated with international wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-woah-memorandum-of-understanding-2024-zoonotic-disease-emergence). The growing list of emerging zoonoses, emerging diseases that spillover from wildlife to humans, led CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to review the intricate relationship between international wildlife trade and zoonotic diseases, and to discuss the role of the Convention in reducing the risk of future zoonotic disease emergence associated with CITES trade.

9. In ground-breaking research [published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8028), scientists at the UN Environmental Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, [reveal the global distribution of more than 35,000 plant species used by people](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/plants-and-their-contributions-to-people-are-insufficiently-protected-globally). Analysis of the first-ever global map of the diversity and rarity of plant species with documented uses by people has found that the highest concentrations of utilised plants are in the Tropics, and that regions with high concentrations of utilised plant species are largely unprotected.

10. Biodiversity data collection is growing, driven in part by international commitments to conservation, market investments and technological advances and the growing urgency of human impacts including climate change. Nations increasingly rely on biodiversity data in order to strategically meet global conservation targets for the coming decades. But not all data is collected equally. A recent [Science publication](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh8874) shows that biodiversity data is increasingly concentrated in wealthy countries. The authors argue that this context should be unearthed to [prevent inequitable implementation of conservation species](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/unpacking-social-equity-biodiversity-data).

11. [GBIF crossed the significant milestone of logging the 10,000th peer-reviewed journal article using and citing data shared through its network](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data). The [10,000th paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2023.2291133) explores the effects of climate change on rhinoceros populations in Southern Africa, and species occurrence records from the GBIF network to model the future distributions of critically endangered black rhinoceros populations and near threatened white rhinoceros populations in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Botswana, Zambia and Tanzania was used. 

12. [Ending deforestation from cocoa in West Africa with new data-driven resources](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/data-resources-ending-deforestation-cocoa-west-africa/). The global demand for chocolate has had a significant impact on West African forests. Approximately 70% of the global supply of cocoa originates from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, where production sites have replaced millions of hectares of forest. Between 2001 and 2015, cocoa was linked to the loss of a third of Ghana's forest area and a quarter of Côte d’Ivoire's. In 2017, the [Cocoa & Forests Initiative](https://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/initiative/cocoa-forests-initiative/) (CFI) was established in an effort to end cocoa-driven deforestation and restore forest areas. Companies that joined the CFI agreed to map their supply chains, align methodologies on deforestation risk assessment and contribute to transparent monitoring and reporting.

13. Following the first case of Avian Influenza in the Galápagos, which was detected in September 2023 and already caused the death of thousands of birds on the South American mainland and also affected mammals as otters, dolphins and sea lions, the Rapid Response Facility, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre and Fauna and Flora joint initiative has provided 40,000 USD to [support active surveillance of seabird populations](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2668), aiming to understand the extent and limit the spread of the potentially devastating virus. Surveys will be carried out at key breeding colonies of Galápagos penguin, albatross and flightless cormorant populations, and collected samples will be analysed for the identification of Avian Influenza. Findings will be shared with the Galápagos National Park Directorate, to inform management interventions, such as potential tourist restrictions and appropriate quarantine measures for specific areas.

**Climate**
1. The Copernicus Climate Change Service showed that the [global mean temperature from February 2023 to January 2024 was the highest on record](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-january-2024), the whole year was above the 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and the average global sea surface temperature for January reached a temperature of 20.97°C, which is the warmest January on record and the second warmest month, which was August 2023. 

2. [A roots up approach to protecting and restoring our natural capital for the good of people and planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-roots-up-approach-to-protecting-and-restoring-our-natural-capital-people-and-planet/). The world's largest land [conference](https://www.acceleratingnbsconference.org/about-1) took place in Zambia from 11 - 15 March 2024 and brought together a range of voices from the climate community to collaborate on advancing nature-based solutions as a critical part of global climate action. 

3. Aviva, a member of the Finance Sector Deforestation Action (FSDA) and Race to Zero explains why [ending deforestation is a prerequisite for both reversing biodiversity loss and meeting net zero targets](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/aviva-achieving-net-zero-by-addressing-deforestation/). Together with 30 other leading financial institutes that are members of the FSDA, have committed to use their best efforts to eliminate agriculture commodity-driven deforestation in their portfolios by 2025.

4. Climate change around Mount Kilimanjaro is real and has affected local communities. UNESCO and the Kilimanjaro National Park authority have implemented a project titled 'Empowering young women and men for [adaptation to climate change at the Kilimanjaro National Park World Heritage site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2665)'. Through the project, scientific data and traditional knowledge on impacts of climate change were collected. Some key findings included provision of conservation education awareness on climate change, strengthening conservation of forests and discouraging farming to water sources. 

5. [The green bond market, currently at 4 trillion USD, needs to expand tenfold to meet the urgent demands of climate action](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/sean-kidney-the-green-bond-market-needs-to-expand-tenfold-to-meet-the-urgent-demands-of-climate-action/). From a modest beginning of 1.5 billion USD, 15 years ago, the market for green, social, and sustainable bonds has exploded to 4 trillion USD today. One significant hurdle for the transition to greener practices is the confusion about actionable steps, compounded by misinformation, such as the underestimated impact of methane leakage from the gas industry, which has muddled energy investment strategies. 

**Oceans**
1. European scientists have [identified and published 100 crucial questions to advance seagrass conservation and restoration efforts in Europe](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10486), and aim to [fill knowledge gaps and prioritise research](https://goosocean.org/news/scientists-point-the-way-to-enhance-conservation-and-restoration-of-essential-marine-life/) to combat climate change and biodiversity loss in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses play a vital role in our oceans by storing carbon in the seabed, enhancing biodiversity, filtering water, and preventing coastal erosion. However, seagrasses have faced widespread decline worldwide, prompting the need for intensified conservation and restoration efforts.

2. In the case of increasing anthropogenic threats to ecosystems and livelihoods, such as marine pollution, climate change events, and over-exploitation of ocean resources, reshaping our connection with the ocean at all scales and across all of society has become imperative. Through its [Challenge 10: 'Change Humanity's Relationship with the Ocean'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzaPG-cqj3Q), the UN Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (the 'Ocean Decade') aims to [encourage behavioural changes and ensure the impact of solutions in improving humanity's relationship with the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/vision-2030-wg10-redefines-humanitys-relationship-with-the-ocean/).

3. [Maturing the Ocean Enterprise: dialogues with Industry Roadmap unveiled](https://goosocean.org/news/maturing-the-ocean-enterprise-dialogues-with-industry-roadmap-unveiled/), a result of the groundbreaking collaboration involving the Global Ocean Observing System, the Marine Technology Society, The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration and industry representatives. 

4. [Introducing new and improved annual turbidity datasets](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/introducing-annual-turbidity-datasets/). When changes of water quality can be observed visually, such as when the azure waters of a tropical region are engulfed by muddy sediment, this type of measurement of water quality is referred to as 'turbidity'. Turbidity can often indicate places and times when land is overly impacting reefs, and monitoring ocean turbidity in the vicinity of coral reefs has become an important, and still growing, challenge for reef conservationists, managers and scientists. Satellite data was retrospectively analysed, so that long-term average trends can be monitored, identifying chronic turbidity. 

5. [HUB Ocean and WWF partner on data-driven solutions](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/hub-ocean-and-wwf-partner-on-data-solutions-for-ocean-healthnbsp) to current and future risks for the blue economy at the intersection of nature and climate. The partnership will accelerate current and future big data and AI-powered products targeting governments, the private sector, and scientific research benefiting people and nature.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Race to resilience partner initiative wins World Habitat Award for early warning tool](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-partner-initiatve-wins-world-habitat-award-for-early-warning-tool/). People living in informal urban settlements are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, like storms, floods and heatwaves. Yet, these communities are often unable to access weather information that could help save their lives or prevent devastating damage to their homes and livelihoods. The Developing Risk Awareness through Joint Action ([DARAJA](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/resurgence-unveils-daraja-africas-boldest-urban-early-warning-initiative/?)) is a weather forecasting and early warning system specifically for residents of informal settlements that operates in Kenya and Tanzania, and is currently being developed in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia.

2. [IHME, Microsoft, and Planet collaborate to map climate-vulnerable populations in unprecedented detail](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ihme-microsoft-and-planet-collaborate-to-map-climate-vulnerable-populations-in-unprecedented-detail/). Across the Global South, many cities and regions are growing much more rapidly than their citizens can be counted, leading to settlements that are much larger than their 'official' population counts. For example, Zinder, in Niger, was estimated to grow at more than 5% annually, but has nearly doubled in size since the last official census in 2012. Knowing in detail where people are located is essential to ensure effective humanitarian action when crises strike. 

3. [Planet, Microsoft and researchers build new AI-focused resource for environmental reporting](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-microsoft-and-researchers-build-new-ai-focused-resource-for-environmental-reporting/). In [accelerating biodiversity and ecosystem reporting](https://learn.planet.com/Microsoft-WhitePaper-Gated.html) readers are taken step-by-step through biodiversity and ecosystem reporting, from scoping to assessing and reporting. Concrete examples from industry and the scientific literature demonstrating how recent advances in EO, AI and ecosystem science can help deliver up-to-date and actionable insights for biodiversity and ecosystem metrics, from ecosystem conversion to the state of species.

4. A comprehensive pilot study aims to [globally map sand and dust storms hazards](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/SandDust), employing remote sensing data, advanced Geographic Information System analysis and cutting-edge software such as Google Earth Engine. The primary objective is to create a detailed hazard map, assessing the frequencies, intensities and trends of the sand and dust storm events worldwide. The study also delves into identifying key drivers behind the sand and dust storm events, including climate change, land cover transformations and overgrazing. 

5. Information on hundreds of territories and areas conserved by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, also known as ICCAs or territories of life, is now publicly available. The [ICCA Registry](https://www.iccaregistry.org/) is an [online reporting platform for strengthening evidence on the conservation importance of ICCAs](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/leading-database-on-conservation-by-indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-opens-to-public), alongside increasing global understanding and recognition of these vital areas and their custodians' conservation practices. ICCA custodians can submit a range of information to the ICCA Registry, including geographical data, photos and case studies, and explore how other communities around the world manage and conserve their territories and areas.

6. A [new study published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8) offers an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean and how it is changing. The study, led by Global Fishing Watch, uses machine learning and satellite imagery to create the [first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/new-research-harnesses-ai-and-satellite-imagery-to-reveal-the-expanding-footprint-of-human-activity-at-sea/), finding a remarkable amount of activity that was previously 'dark' to public monitoring systems. The analysis reveals that about 75% of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked. More than 25% of transport and energy vessel activity are also missing from public tracking systems. 

7. [GBIF has renewed its successful partnership with DataCamp Donates](https://www.gbif.org/news/yEwhAKzjLvyV7lFZzqqTj/continued-partnership-to-improve-data-literacy-for-gbif-users), enabling data users from across much of its network to access valuable training and improve their data skills. In the past year, 70 GBIF community members completed 115 courses through the learning platform together, covering topics such as programming, data manipulation, probability and statistics, data visualisation and machine learning.

8. [The Copernicus Marine Service launches the Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-ocean-climate-portal). The [Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/ocean-climate-portal) is an innovative platform designed to provide information about our oceans, with a user-friendly interface for accessing a range of ocean  indicators. This presents a significant step forward in our understanding of the impact of climate change on our oceans.

9. [BioEcoOcean - New Horizon EU project to co-create and test a globally applicable blueprint for integrated ocean science](https://www.obis.org/2024/03/13/bioecoocean-new-project/). This comprehensive blueprint will become a tool to guide ocean observing programs from the early planning stages, to data collection, to integrating results into policy and decision making. The blueprint will include data management aspects to facilitate standardisation of ocean observation data, and flow into global repositories like OBIS. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [MapTiler Engine 13.2 is out](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/02/effortless-uploads-to-maptiler-cloud-from-maptiler-engine-13-2/), with the possibilities to automate the entire map processing and publishing process from the command line interface. It is easier to share maps online, and there is now a direct line to support and product feedback. 

2. [MapTiler Server 4.5 is out](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/02/create-beautiful-tile-mosaics-with-maptiler-server-4-5/), which allows to blend imagery of different datasets into one layer, and has updated compatibility with different operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS and Docker). 

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [5th OpenAIRE Open Science Train-the-Trainer bootcamp](https://www.openaire.eu/5th-openaire-open-science-train-the-trainer-bootcamp) will be held from 13 - 17 May, 2024. The application deadline is the 17th of March, and results will be announced on the 29th of March. 

2. [Harmonising metadata across disciplines - bioschemas and the DataCite metadata schema](https://datacite.org/blog/bioschemas_2024/). [Schemas.org](https://schema.org/) and [Biochemas.org](https://bioschemas.org/types/BioSample/0.1-RELEASE-2019_06_19) are two initiatives that try to close the gap of interoperability by making sure that important information can be  found through both general search engines and specialised databases, especially in the life sciences.
