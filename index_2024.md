### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. At IPBES-11, held from 10 - 16 December, the summary for policymakers for [nexus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13850289) and [transformative change](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11382230) were approved, as well as the scoping report for the second global assessment.

2. More articles on the highlights and lessons learned from CoP16 were published:
  - [CITES highlights interlinkages to diverse aspects of biodiversity conservation at CBD CoP16, looks ahead to CITES CoP20 in 2025](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-highlights-interlinkages-to-diverse-aspects-of-biodiversity-conservation-at-cbdcop16-2024). Near the end of the meeting, the CITES Secretariat reaffirmed its commitment to working in collaboration with the CBD and other global stakeholders to ensure the survival of CITES-listed species in the wild and to achieve the shared vision of a sustainable future. The upcoming CITES CoP20 next year will further this momentum in contributing to the achievement of the KMGBF, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the CITES Strategic Vision 2030, so that all international trade in CITES-listed species is conducted in a sustainable, legal and traceable manner.
  - [At COP16 the focus on ocean biodiversity reached new heights, highlighting the pivotal role of global coordination in ocean observing and data accessibility to achieve global biodiversity targets](https://oceandecade.org/news/cop16-outcomes-ocean-observing-and-data-for-biodiversity-conservation/): this year's COP featured a dedicated Ocean Day and numerous side events focusing on marine biodiversity and advancing ocean observing efforts. The conference underscored the alignment between biodiversity and climate strategies, emphasizing that effective ocean conservation requires cooperation across different UN conventions. This was highlighted by calls for better integration of national biodiversity and climate plans, stressing the ocean's importance in mitigating climate change and supporting adaptation efforts. The UNESCO-IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) plays a [pivotal role in supporting several GBF targets and indicators](https://goosocean.org/news/cop16-outcomes-ocean-observing-and-data-for-biodiversity-conservation/) by providing essential ocean data. Since 2012, GOOS has coordinated marine biological and ecosystems observations, structured around a set of Essential Ocean Variables to monitor marine biodiversity comprehensively.
  - [GEO milestones at COP16: launching the global ecosystem atlas proof-of-concept and championing earth intelligence](https://earthobservations.org/news/geo-milestones-cbd-cop16). Amid the energy of the largest biodiversity COP yet, standout achievements, such as the establishment of a permanent body for Indigenous Peoples and local communities and the creation of the 'Cali Fund', signal hope for transformative change in global biodiversity efforts. COP16 was also marked by formidable challenges, and the recommendations from an ad-hoc expert group on the establishment of a more comprehensive and dynamic monitoring framework, which should be regularly reviewed, was not yet adopted. The [Global Ecosystems Atlas](https://globalecosystemsatlas.org/) is one of the solutions presented before the parties, and intends to support countries to rack and achieve their targets, turning global commitments into measurable success. Norway's 2.5 million USD pledge to support the continued Atlas' development, announced in Cali, underscores its revolutionary potential.
  - [Marine perspectives on COP16-reinforced global collaborations to better support conservation](https://www.obis.org/2024/11/24/COP16/). The Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) is included in the framework as a complementary indicator for Goal D (Invest and Collaborate), Target 20 (Strengthen Capacity-Building, Technology Transfer, and Scientific and Technical Cooperation for Biodiversity) and Target 21 (Ensure that knowledge is available and accessible to guide biodiversity action). By recognizing the critical roles of OBIS, GOOS and ODIS in advancing global biodiversity goals, COP16 marked a turning point for ocean observations and marine conservation efforts. Obis was also added to the list of tools designed to help countries monitor biodiversity and track progress in ocean, species, and ecosystem protection. 
  - GEO BON wrote a report [GEO BON highlights COP16](https://geobon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/COP16-highlights.pdf), describing the highlights and engagement events.

3. The Canary islands are home to a unique and diverse range of species, including several pollinators, including specialised bees, butterflies and hoverflies, found nowhere else in the world. These pollinators are crucial for maintaining the delicate ecosystems in the region, in particular, the Laurel Forest, in which these pollinators are responsible for pollinating many of the islands' native plants, which in turn support the islands' broader wildlife and ecological balance. The [Canarian Islands endemic pollinators of the Laurel Forest Zone - Conservation plan 2023-2028](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/81542e9b-f9e8-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) was created as part of the [European Commission's EU Pollinators Initiative](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/nature-and-biodiversity/pollinators_en). Broadly, the Initiative calls for [action to address the rapid loss of pollinator species](https://iucnsos.org/implementing-the-eu-pollinators-initiative-action-to-protect-the-canary-islands-endemic-pollinators/), whose decline threatens not only biodiversity, but also agriculture, food production, and ecosystem health.

4. As part of this year's [World Lemur Day celebrations in Madagascar](https://iucnsos.org/celebrating-world-lemur-day-with-iucn-save-our-species-in-madagascar-for-the-first-time/), conservationists, local and national authorities, communities, and civil society organisations were brought together to acknowledge the urgent need to protect lemurs and their habitats, as 94% of them face the risk of extinction. 

5. Although intuitively it may seem obvious what a forest is, there are actually hundreds of definitions used by different countries and organisations throughout the world. This can have major implications for how forests, and more importantly, changes to forests, are measured: [without a common and standardized way to define forests, it is impossible to track global deforestation](https://www.wri.org/insights/rethinking-definition-forest-monitoring). Many countries use satellite data for this tracking because it provides more timely, accurate and efficient information. But most existing forest definitions do not align with what satellites can actually measure. It is time to rethink forest definitions so that forests and deforestation are quantified consistently and reliably enough to evaluate whether global forest conservation outcomes have been achieved. 

6. Global Forest Watch's (GFW) [deforestation alerts provide information about loss of trees in near-real-time](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/global-vegetation-disturbance-deforestation-alerts/), making them a critical tool for those working to combat deforestation. Existing alerts on GFW have been used to help Indigenous and local communities protect their forests, halt and prosecute environmental crimes and protect threatened wildlife. Previously, alerts were only available for tropical forests, but now a new alert system, [DIST-ALERT](https://gfw.global/401umrm), provides alerts within forests globally as well as alerts where other ecosystems are disturbed, such as grasslands, savannas, shrublands, wetlands and crops. 

7. Healthy forests sustain biodiversity, livelihoods and local economies. Home to most of the planet's terrestrial species, forests provide millions of people with jobs, along with food and fuel for more than 90% of the world's most vulnerable populations. When forests are threatened, so are the benefits they provide and the survival of wildlife. To strengthen responses in addressing illegal trade in tree species listed in the Appendices on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in collaboration with the CITES Secretariat, hosted a [regional training on physical inspection of timber shipments and risk assessment](https://cites.org/eng/news/empowering-law-enforcement-officers-to-tackle-illegal-timber-trade-in-africa-2024). Participants learned to identify and assess risks, detect concealed timber specimens, and verify CITES permits and certificates.

8. On the 3rd of March, 2025, [World Wildlife Day will be celebrated](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/world-wildlife-day-2025-theme-wildlife-conservation-finance) under the critical theme [Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/events/wwd/2025/WWD2025_Concept_Note.pdf). The events will serve as a platform for exchanging ideas, showcasing solutions and advancing the conservation on how innovative finance can contribute to halting biodiversity loss, raising the interest of private sector stakeholders to invest in wildlife conservation, and creating a sustainable future. There will be a World Wildlife Day Film Showcase, and the [deadline to enter (for free) is the 3rd of January 2025](https://www.jacksonwild.org/world-wildlife-day). 

9. [Legends save lives: why local wisdom matters for people and planet](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/legends-save-lives-why-local-wisdom-matters-people-and-planet?hub=408). Thailand's national ecosystem assessment, with UNESCO's support, aims to highlight the role of Indigenous and local knowledge in natural resources management. When the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami struck in 2004, the Moken people of the Surin Islands in the Andaman Sea witnessed the receding seawater when the placid weather remained unchanged. For Moken elders, this was a harbinger of the 'Laboon', the furious god of the waves who is said to wreak devastation once every two generations. The entire community evacuated to higher ground, and the Moken seafarers who were taking tourists out for snorkelling manoeuvred their boats away from the shoreline, thereby saving numerous lives in one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. This example powerfully underscores the value of local knowledge acquired through direct interaction with the environment, and transmitted orally through legends that encapsulate accumulated multigenerational experience and intimate familiarity with local ecosystems. Nevertheless, this body of knowledge has historically been overlooked. Incorporating local knowledge into the National Ecosystem Assessment not only enhances our understanding of ecosystem services but also helps safeguard the contribution of local communities in natural resources management. In order to reverse the tide on the loss of indigenous and local knowledge, UNESCO has been championing community-based research in many countries around the world, including Thailand. The aim is to leverage local insights in gathering and presenting data that can inform policy-making related to managing natural protected areas. Moreover, the activities provide a platform for intergenerational communication, whereby elders’ wisdom for coexistence with nature can be imparted to ethnic youth.

10. [GBIF is funding four new projects under the 2024 Capacity and Enhancement Support Programme](https://www.gbif.org/news/3okvYq9bTj7SpSNTs2P3jT/four-new-projects-selected-to-receive-funding-under-the-2024-capacity-and-enhancement-support-programme), which aims to address specific capacity needs identified by GBIF Participants by facilitating collaboration at regional and global levels, supporting the goals of the 2024 Nodes implementation plan. The four projects are: [enhancing institutional capacity for data management in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2024-006/); [developing a data extension for documenting socio-biodiversity information](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2024-015/); [AI for specimen labels](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2024-016/); and [building capacity within biodiversity data between Ethiopia and GBIF nodes in Sweden and Finland](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2024-013/). The [call for proposals for 2025 has opened](https://www.gbif.org/news/1ehSrAN20UAGOEAgfINr5E/call-for-proposals-for-2025-capacity-enhancement-support-programme), and the deadline is on the 4th of February, 2025. Proposed projects should involve one or more of the following action types to be eligible for support: mentoring activities, support for regional events and training workshops, documentation (including the standardization of documentation, routine updates, versioning, translations, community input, peer review and searchable format) and other capacity development collaborations within the GBIF network. Funded projects are expected to start in September 2025, for a maximum of 18 months.

11. The Centre for World Natural Heritage Management and Training for the Asia and Pacific Region, a UNESCO Category 2 Centre, at the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, India, will organise [two training courses on natural heritage management in 2025](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2733): a course on natural heritage, from the 20th - 31st of January, 2025, and a course on natural heritage management from the 17th of February to the 14th of March, 2025. Both courses are fully funded by the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, and are open to non-Indian candidates from developing and least-developed countries.

12. [Revealing the hidden costs of what we eat](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/revealing-hidden-costs-what-we-eat). Shifting our diets to be more sustainable can be a powerful way for each of us to address both climate change and global food insecurity, however making such adjustments at the large scales necessary to make a difference globally can be a delicate matter. An international collaboration of researchers set out to understand where and how environmental pressures might occur within hypothetical global shifts to each of four types of diets: Indian, Mediterranean, EAT-Lancet (largely plant-based, 'flexitarian') and average government-recommended-food-based dietary guidelines, and published their results in the [journal Environmental Research Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad8509). Available data on a variety of factors was used, including countries' average diets, trade flow and the global environmental pressures of food production. The Indian diet was found to be the most beneficial of the four, with an estimated 20.9% reduction in food production-based global environmental pressure. The government-recommended food-based dietary guidelines however have a potential 35.2% global increase in environmental pressure. "A big message from our work", summarized Halpern (one of the researchers), "is that the decisions we make about what we eat are important for reducing our environmental footprint, but other people may pay the price for those decisions." When the world would shift toward more sustainable, plant-forward diets, lower-income countries would see an increase to their food-production related environmental pressures. 

13. The book 'State of Traditional Knowledge of Biodiversity in Bosnia and Herzegovina', meant to contribute to their national ecosystem assessment, was [launched](https://www.besnet.world/launch-of-the-state-of-traditional-knowledge-of-biodiversity-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina-book/) at the end of November, 2024, and is available in [English](https://fondeko.org/publication/) and [Bosnian](https://fondeko.org/publikacija/) languages. A launch event, held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, showcased the value and critical role of the country's traditional and local knowledge in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

14. Determining the boundaries of different forest types allows us to better understand how forests are changing over time. A longstanding limitation of the tree cover data available on Global Forest Watch has been the inability to differentiate planted forests and tree crops from primary and secondary natural forests. There is no globally consistent data available on the location of planted trees, making it difficult to determine whether tree cover change occurred in natural forests or if it was simply due to harvesting or management activities in planted trees. A new version of the [Spatial Database of Planted Trees](https://gfw.global/2Qbv7fM), which provides broader geographic coverage and several key updates, is now available, which [includes key information on each integrated data set](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/updated-planted-trees-map-near-global-coverage/), including the planted tree type (planted forest or tree crop), original data source information and carbon removal factors, and, where available, species information, as well as the method and year(s) of imagery used to determine the planted tree boundary.

**Climate**
1. [Six insights on green demand and systems thinking](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/six-insights-on-green-demand-and-systems-thinking/). A 'system' is a network of interconnected and dynamic elements that evolve together over time. Systems thinking helps us understand the relationships and feedback loops within these networks, providing a way to address complex social-ecological challenges. System change levers are powerful tools that can shift the structure of economic, environmental, or social systems. These levers include demand, technology and supply, policy, finance, and civil society.  One of the main challenges to systems change in climate mitigation is the insufficient demand for green products, especially in high-emission sectors like cement and steel. The Green Demand Gap is the difference between current demand for green products and the level needed to meet climate change. By embracing systems thinking and aligning actions across key levers of change, the global community can make significant strides towards closing the Green Demand Gap and accelerating meaningful climate actions.

2. In October 2024, the [UN Emissions Gap Report](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwg-24BhB_EiwA1ZOx8mx-Wvbq0-hnfoixE-S-TPGaXOMbPiEMj57Y7mkgCGIgg_8dLiGuEhoCw4cQAvD_BwE) starkly laid out the scale of the challenge that the global community faces if we are to keep planetary warming below the 2°C limit, with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C goal almost certainly out of reach already. Without making significant changes we risk jeopardizing not only those SDGs that focus explicitly on protecting the natural environment, but also those that rely on the prospect of secure and stable livelihoods, free from natural disaster, displacement or unrest. However, [the pace of progress has not accelerated with the speed of commitment making](https://sdg-action.org/net-zero-saboteurs/). One reason is the hugh disconnect among business leaders between their net-zero commitments and their own policy advocacy work, despite the fact that the IPCC has been clear that meeting our climate commitments will require a huge amount of new and interconnected policy and regulation from national governments: nearly a quarter of the companies that made net-zero commitments had continued to directly lobby governments to weaken or stall proposed climate policies, and an even greater proportion did not engage on policy at all. The second, more entrenched and less visible reason is indirect lobbying via industry associations. Industry associations claim to act as a united voice for businesses and exist in all the world's largest industries. By using these narratives, industry associations legitimize and strengthen support for vested fossil fuels interests, regardless of the extent to which they are supported by their memberships.

3. Two recent reports, the [2024 Emissions Gap Report](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024) and the [2024 Adaptation Gap Report](https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024) underline [the fact that the world is not doing nearly enough to combat the climate crisis](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/cop29-in-baku-our-delegates-reflect-on-activities-so-far), which is also the fastest growing threat to biodiversity. The first stresses that without urgent action on emissions reduction, we will not meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The evidence shows that if current policies alone were to be implemented, the outcome would be a catastrophic increase of up to 3.1°C, while the current ambition is to limit it to 1.5°C to avoid dangerous climate change. The latter documents progress in adaptation planning, finance and action worldwide, but despite an upward trend highlights an estimated shortfall in international finance flows to developing countries of around 187 - 359 billion USD per year, and also shows that many existing adaptation projects will not achieve the adaptation outcomes required due to issues such as lack of clear baselines, technical complexities and poor implementation structures.

4. The [NASA Disasters Program selected seven groundbreaking projects that will harness the power of Earth observations to help communities better understand, prepare for, and recover from disasters and extreme events](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/nasa-selects-seven-new-projects-advance-disaster-science). Projects range from collaborations with electric utilities to enhance power grid resilience against severe storms and solar events to partnerships with insurance companies to better assess severe weather risks and to work with transportation planners on protecting critical infrastructure. 

5. Although drought is covered by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, for a long time this issue has been neglected in practice: [management of drought has tended towards reactive responses, rather than preventative measures](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/key-takeaways-from-unccd-cop16). There are 70 countries in the world that are regularly affected by droughts, and it is estimated that by 2050 droughts may affect over three quarters of the world's population. At COP16, the new Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership was announced by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will leverage public and private finance to support 80 of the most vulnerable and drought-hit countries around the world, shifting the focus from reactive response to proactive action. 

**Oceans**
1. Senegal's Atlantic tuna fishery has made history by becoming the [first in West Africa to receive Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2024/11/15/senegalese-fishery-becomes-first-ever-msc-certified-in-west-africa), following a four-year Fishery Improvement Project. The fishery targets eastern Atlantic skipjack and Atlantic yellowfin tuna. Throughout the project, the fishery made significant strides. One key action was the introduction of non-entangling Fish Aggregating Devices made from biodegradable materials (such as bamboo and coconut fibre) to reduce environmental impact. The fishery also implemented enhanced data collection methods to track species encounters, and collaborated with local fisheries authorities to train observers for monitoring at-sea activities.

2. The 17th edition of the [Love Planet Earth](https://oceandecade.org/news/love-planet-earth-2025-glacier-conservation-calendar/) 2025 calendar is available to [download](https://www.e-geos.it/en/love-planet-earth/2025/) (and the photos of individual months can be used as PC backgrounds), showing the beauty and fragility of polar ecosystems and the technological and environmental efforts needed to preserve them. 

3. To support developing countries in responding to global crises and achieving the SDGs, the world's leading economies need to enhance global collaboration and investment in ocean prediction systems and technology. To improve data access and interoperability, worldwide efforts have established a network of 101 data centres in 68 countries. However, [despite technology advances, a combination of inflation and flat national funding means that there has been no significant growth in ocean observations in the last five years](https://oceandecade.org/news/equitable-ocean-prediction-systems-bridging-the-north-south-divide/). By encouraging philanthropic funding organisations to share best practices and pool resources, the dialogue strengthens the network's capacity to develop large-scale ocean science projects and new members can be attracted to join the initiative. Therefore, a joint statement, the 2024 [Rio Action Statement](https://oceandecade.org/pdfviewer/rio-action-statement/) was developed, a [bold roadmap for philanthropy to drive resource mobilization, outreach, advocacy and partnerships](https://oceandecade.org/news/2024-rio-action-statement-to-steer-philanthropic-leadership-in-ocean-action/), backed by 25 foundations, in support of the Ocean Decade initiative ahead of the 2025 UN Ocean Conference. 

4. How do we collaborate for a better understanding of life in the ocean? How do we enable and facilitate communication at different scales and across sectors? The Horizon Europe project BioEcoOcean is spearheading efforts to answer these questions and improve collaboration and understanding of marine life through the [development of a Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science](https://www.obis.org/2024/11/25/bioecocean-blueprintsurvey/). With co-creation at its core, BioEcoOcean invites the community to contribute through workshop surveys and testing. The [first survey](https://doit.medfarm.uu.se/bin/kurt3/kurt/8869543) is currently open, until the 15th of January 2025, and aims to gather feedback on challenges and opportunities in connecting the suggested components in the Blueprint, and takes about 8-10 minutes to complete. 

5. [How fishers are protecting their communities from hurricanes](https://oceandecade.org/news/how-fishers-are-protecting-their-communities-from-hurricanes/). On the 19th of October, 2024, tropical storm Oscar crept up from the North Atlantic Ocean at a leisurely 40 miles per hour, and ambled toward the Turks and Caicos Islands. Based on the data available, meteorologists believed the tiny storm was unlikely to cause major damage, but, only three hours later, Oscar's wind speeds had somehow doubled to a destructive 80 miles per hour - and the tropical storm was now a Category 1 Hurricane. One day earlier, Cuba's power grid failed and plunged the nation into a blackout. Without internet or electricity, there was no way to dispatch warmings to all of the 11 million Cubans scattered across the island. Hurricane Oscar hit the coast of Cuba on the evening of the 20th, destroying thousands of homes, and killing at least 8 people. What if Hurricane Oscar had been forecasted one week in advance, instead of one day? The problem is that ocean data is expensive and incomplete. Currently, it is only collected in the deep seas, far from hurricane impact zones, or by satellites, which failed to accurately monitor Hurricane Oscar due to its small size. Meteorologists need more ocean data, fast. The [Fishing Vessel Ocean Observing Network](https://oceandecade.org/news/how-fishers-are-protecting-their-communities-from-hurricanes/) (FVON) sees the solution in the two million fishing vessels floating over the world's coasts. By attaching sensors to fishing gear, ocean data can be continuously collected in hurricane-prone regions to improve forecasts and save lives. By 2030, FVON envisions that tens of thousands of fishing vessels will be equipped with sensors and leading the ocean data collection effort across the globe. 

6. A new review carried out by biodiversity experts at the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre has found that [offshore wind energy developments have a range of both positive and negative impacts on underwater animals that migrate](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-offshore-wind-projects-can-affect-marine-migratory-species), including whales, porpoises, seals, various fish and crustaceans. The overall effects of offshore wind infrastructure on migratory species tend to be negative, especially during the construction phase. Some fish populations experienced positive effects, when they benefited from the refuge provided by the new infrastructure. Knowledge gaps were identified, both in terms of species and also relating to wind farm types, operations and locations. With offshore wind developments expected to grow six-fold by 2030, there is an urgent need to understand the range of impacts these projects can have and mitigate impacts as far as possible. Taking such action is good for business, as it minimises financial, regulatory and reputational risks. It also helps to future-proof operations, as organisations incorporating biodiversity-conscious measures will be more likely to benefit in a sustainability-focused landscape.

**Pollution**
1. [UN plastic pollution summit fails to reach agreement despite majority supporting ambitious measures](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/un-plastic-pollution-summit-fails-to-reach-agreement-despite-majority-supporting-ambitious-measures). WWF calls on countries to unite on the necessary binding upstream measures to end plastic pollution, develop the lists of products and chemicals to be banned, and to conclude the negotiation process as soon as possible. Essential measures of a future agreement must include global bans and phaseouts of harmful plastics and chemicals, global product design, a robust finance mechanism, and means for strengthening the treaty over time.

2. Sailors and teams competing in last year's The Ocean Race, a challenge to be the first to cross 60,000 km of ocean space, took the opportunity to [contribute data and samples to scientific studies on microplastic and microfibre pollution](https://oceandecade.org/news/microplastics-europe-a-hotspot-for-pollution-says-the-ocean-race/). The data collected shows that three of the world's top five hotspots for marine microplastic pollution are in Europe, and the greatest concentration was found close to South Africa. It was also revealed that there is an overwhelming tendency for microplastics to derive from the microfibres of synthetic clothing and textile.
 
**New platforms and initiatives**
1. Marine invasive species threaten biodiversity, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Fiji. These organisms disrupt fragile marine ecosystems, endanger native species, and undermine the blue economy. PacMAN was designed to combat these challenges by equipping Fiji with state-of-the-art tools, robust protocols, and expert training to enable rapid detection and effective management. The key achievements of PacMAN are innovative monitoring protocols, cutting-edge molecular techniques (Fiji's first-ever environmental DNA training), scientific insights (188 samples were analysed using metabarcoding), technological advancements (development of the PacMAN bioinformatics pipeline) and regional leadership (risk-assessment of thousands of species to inform proactive management strategies). The success of PacMAN, achieving the [Marine Invasive Species Monitoring-Ready status](https://www.obis.org/2024/11/21/pacman-conclusion-news/), underscores the importance of local capacity building and innovative science in achieving meaningful progress toward biodiversity conservation goals. The conclusion of PacMan marks a significant milestone, but the fight against marine invasive species continues. With [strengthened capacity, advanced tools, and a collaborative framework](https://oceandecade.org/news/pacman-fiji-achieves-marine-invasive-species-monitoring-ready-status-as-project-is-completed/), Fiji is well-equipped to safeguard its marine environments and inspire similar efforts across the Pacific.

2. Spanning 21 marine World Heritage sites in 19 countries, the [UNESCO eDNA Expeditions pilot program demonstrated the transformative potential of citizen science](https://www.obis.org/2024/12/09/eDNAdashboard/) in enhancing ocean biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), in collaboration with the World Heritage Centre, implemented cutting-edge eDNA sampling techniques and developed an advanced data dashboard for the programme, paving the way for future large-scale biodiversity monitoring campaigns. eDNA is an affordable, non-invasive, reliable and efficient biodiversity monitoring method that relies on collecting and analyzing genetic material shed by organisms in their surroundings. 396 samples were taken at 21 sites, which resulted in the identification of more than 4400 marine species. 120 species listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List were found. The [study](https://oceandecade.org/publications/engaging-communities-to-safeguard-ocean-life-unesco-environmental-dna-expeditions/) also determined that many of these species will soon be confronted with temperatures exceeding their known tolerance limits. Based on the warmest future climate scenario, up to 100% of fish species in the tropical and subtropical sites studied would exceed their current thermal limits and be potentially endangered, while 10 - 50% of fish species in temperate oceans would exceed their current thermal limits. This eDNA programme marks the [first standardized application of eDNA sampling to monitor the status of marine species among global biodiversity hotspots](https://oceandecade.org/news/unesco-has-mapped-4500-species-thanks-to-its-pioneering-edna-programme/). With a single 1.5-liter water sample, eDNA techniques can reveal genetic traces of approximately 100 marine species on average. 

3. Illegal logging presents a major global environmental challenge. Advancements in Earth observation technology is making it easier for authorities to combat this issue; [high-frequency satellite imagery and data helps officials to monitor change](https://www.planet.com/pulse/leveraging-satellite-based-solutions-for-illegal-logging/) across vast areas and allow them to respond quickly. Traditional land use monitoring was done with periodic surveys, aerial photography and ground inspections, which can still be helpful, but due to the cost and effort, these surveys were usually done periodically, making it difficult to detect rapid land use changes. [Governments and other entities can use daily satellite technology to improve natural resource management and land use compliance in many ways](https://www.planet.com/pulse/how-governments-track-changing-land-use-with-planet-near-daily-satellite-imagery/), including deforestation monitoring, urban development and agriculture compliance.

**News and updates about applications**

It will facilitate general ownership of the Regional Action Plan and integration into the region's day-to-day efforts to implement the World Heritage Convention, in an integrated way with the States Parties' planning programmes.

**Indices and indicators**
1. WMO's State of Climate 2024 update has sounded the alarm on the pace of climate change, with 2024 on course to be the hottest year in history. Days of extreme heat are becoming more intense and more frequent, especially in urban areas and cities. One of the overlooked risks is that urban residents in high-rise buildings are uniquely vulnerable to dangerous heat exposure. The [Urban Heat-Health Risk Index (UHHRI)](https://earthobservations.org/news/above-ground-level-how-address-heat-risks-tall-buildings), developed by HSR.health, offers a groundbreaking approach for assessing these risks and identifying vulnerable populations. The heat exposure of tall buildings is different compared to ground-level structures as there is increased solar radiation, resulting in hotter interior temperatures, there are cooling challenges, as it is harder to pump cool air and water to the upper floors of high-rise buildings, and the evacuation difficulties: the higher the building, the more difficult to evacuate. The UHHRI considers social determinants of health, such as age, income level and pre-existing health conditions, alongside environmental factors like land cover and building type. By incorporating building-specific data, such as solar exposure and cooling challenges, the UHHRI can assess the heightened risks faced by residents in tall buildings. 

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [How can we CARE more in environmental research?](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/how-can-we-care-more-environmental-research) In a scientific landscape that encourages open data and open science, Indigenous data sovereignty and governance have become increasingly important yet can be overlooked. Indigenous data includes data, information, and knowledge that has an impact on Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities, either at the collective or individual level. This includes data about non-human relations (e.g. land, water, territories, plants, animals, etc.) and data about Indigenous Peoples as a collective (e.g. traditions, cultural information, languages, ancestral knowledges, etc.). The Arctic Data Center is the primary data repository for NSF-funded Arctic researchers, and implements the CARE principles by documenting ethical data procedures and tagging data sensitivity on submitted datasets. To assist with this process, the ADC has a [newly updated site](https://arcticdata.io/data-ethics/) with resources for ethical research practices that provides tips for writing your ERP statement and some ethical concerns to consider depending on your field. They provide resources for general Arctic research, archeology and paleontology, human participation and sensitive data, marine sciences, physical sciences, plants and soil sciences, spatial data, and wildlife sciences.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [AI threats and cybersecurity: protecting the digital world](https://aiforgood.itu.int/ai-threats-and-cybersecurity-protecting-the-digital-world/). As AI shapes both innovation and risk, the threat landscape of cybercrime is rapidly evolving. There are 4 significant AI-related threats that cybersecurity professionals are grappling with: 1. weaponized AI, the use of generative AI and other advanced AI techniques to create more lethal and effective malicious software; 2. AI system vulnerabilities, as many AI systems are not fully transparent or predictable, they are susceptible to attacks; 3. new software vulnerabilities, the rapid adoption of AI-powered co-pilots and generative models in software development introduces new vulnerabilities that we still don't understand, and that attackers are waiting to exploit; 4. AI for attacking human minds, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting human cognition through sophisticated social engineering attacks, phishing scams and other manipulative tactics. AI makes cyberattacks more efficiently and less costly.

2. During the AI for Good webinar titled '[Shaping tomorrow's plates: the future of food with AI](https://youtu.be/DQrpE7MXCY0)', experts discussed [how AI is transforming global food systems](https://aiforgood.itu.int/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-food-systems-for-a-sustainable-future/). AI could be used to optimise consumption trends, and in the EU's strides in precision agriculture, it is already used by optimizing crop yields, reducing waste and limiting chemical use. AI also has potential in developing resilient crops and alternative proteins, which is crucial for meeting future global food demands sustainably. The panel explored ethical challenges in applying AI to food systems, focusing on responsibility, inclusivity, and equitable access.

3. [The European Commission hosted a high-level roundtable on advancing science with AI](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/commission-hosts-high-level-roundtable-advancing-science-ai-2024-12-12_en). The growing role of AI acts as a catalyst for scientific breakthroughs, and it is a key instrument in the scientific process, helping to tackle pressing challenges like climate change, health, and the green and digital transitions, while keeping Europe at the cutting edge of scientific progress. The recent [opinion of the Scientific Advisory Mechanism](https://scientificadvice.eu/advice/artificial-intelligence-in-science/) of the European Commission suggests accelerating the integration of AI in science in a responsible manner. [Developing a policy on AI in Science](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1e2a4c9c-d3f1-43e9-9488-c8152aabf25f_en) will aim to accelerate the adoption of AI by scientists, by creating essential enablers, such as improved access to data, computational power and talent.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 16) was held in Cali, Colombia from 21 October to 1 November 2024. Different organisations and platforms published articles and blogs before and during the COP, but also with the results and ways forward afterwards.
  - [WWF: Some successes, but COP16 in Cali ends in disappointment, with crucial finance agreements delayed](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/some-successes-but-cop16-in-cali-ends-in-disappointment-with-crucial-finance-agreements-delayed). Although a new global fund dedicated to sharing the benefits derived from using digital sequence information from genetic resources was established, from which 50% will be allocated to Indigenous Peoples and local communities, the final negotiations have been postponed, risking undermining of the confidence and implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 
  - [IUCN Save Our Species: Advancing species conservation at CBD COP16: event highlights from the IUCN Species Convention Action team](https://iucnsos.org/advancing-species-conservation-at-cbd-cop16-event-highlights-from-the-iucn-species-convention-action-team/). The IUCN hosted two side events, one on the urgent need to address the growing species extinction crisis, primarily driven by human activities, and one on the [Global Species Action Plan](https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/51362) and its [Online Knowledge Platform](https://gsapskills.org/), and how they can be used to support CBD Parties and stakeholders in implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
  - [Marine Stewardship Council: Remember the ocean: prioritising marine biodiversity at COP 16](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2024/10/29/remember-the-ocean-prioritising-marine-biodiversity-at-cop-16).  Around 80% of governments have failed to submit updated National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans ahead of the COP. These plans will set the stage for decades of work to protect nature. Although marine biodiversity is being largely neglected in global conservation efforts, it is vital that they integrate marine biodiversity, securing necessary commitments and funding to protect our oceans alongside terrestrial ecosystems, as the ocean is our greatest ally in combating biodiversity loss and climate change.
  - [GOOS: GOOS at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP16)](https://goosocean.org/news/goos-at-the-united-nations-biodiversity-conference-cop16/). During this COP, governments will be tasked with reviewing the state of implementation of GBF. Increased pressures from human activities and climate change are driving critical changes in the ocean, making urgent action necessary to protect its biodiversity and meet the GBF targets. Effective management relies on what we can measure, and data-driven ocean action depends on sustained ocean observations and data accessibility.
  - [CITES at CBD CoP16: "Peace with Nature" by ensuring trade in wild species is sustainable, legal and traceable](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-at-cbd-cop16-2024). The most relevant goals and targets for CITES are: Goal A: human induced extinction of known threatened species is halted, and by 2050, the extinction rate and risk of all species are reduced tenfold, and the abundance of native wild species is increased to healthy and resilient levels; Target 4: ensure urgent management actions to halt human induced extinction of known threatened species and for the recovery and conservation of species; Target 5: ensure that the use, harvesting and trade of wild species is sustainable, safe and legal, preventing overexploitation, minimising impacts on non-target species and ecosystems and reducing the risk of pathogen spill-over; and Target 9: ensure that the management and use of wild species are sustainable.
  - [UNEP-WCMC: Five key issues that the world will discuss at this year's crucial biodiversity meeting](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/five-key-issues-world-will-discuss-at-cop16). Across the board, the world needs greater transparency and accountability, and increased action on implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The key issues are 1: enhance national monitoring and implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework, 2: Accelerate biodiversity finance from public and private sources, 3: Share the benefits from the use of genetic information fairly and equitably for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; 4: Ensures that protected and conserved areas are in the right places, equitable and effective; and 5: Commit to using indicators on traditional knowledge and gender. 

2. The [world must act faster to protect 30% of the planet by 2030](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/world-must-act-faster-to-protect-30-of-planet). The [Protected Planet Report 2024](http://digitalreport.protectedplanet.net/) reveals that 17.6% of land and inland waters and 8.4% of the ocean and coastal areas globally are within documented protected and conserved areas. The increase in coverage since 2020 is to be celebrated, but it is a rise of less than 0.5% in both realms. Over the next 6 years, the global network will need to be urgently expanded by a further 12.4% on land and 21.6% in the ocean. Strongest progress since 2020 has been in the ocean, but most of this has been in national waters. In areas beyond national jurisdiction, coverage remains very low, despite the fact that the high seas cover 61% of the ocean. Additionally, there is little evidence that protected and conserved areas are equitably governed, less than 4% of coverage is governed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, while beyond protected and conserved areas, Indigenous and traditional territories cover at least 13.6% of global terrestrial areas.

3. UNEP-WCMC scientists [released](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/businesses-and-governments-must-act-to-standardise-core-metrics-if-we-are-to-halt-biodiversity-loss) a [paper 'Global metrics for terrestrial biodiversity](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-environ-121522-045106) during the COP, in which the challenges faced when implementing effective biodiversity metrics were examined. Over the past decade, businesses, governments and civil society have made ever-increasing pledges and commitments to address the climate and biodiversity crises. In the paper, a database of 573 metrics, indicators, indices and layers are whittled down to a more focussed list that will have the most impact on governments and businesses. Biodiversity metrics used by governments are often politically agreed upon at different levels: national, regional, subnational, etc. At COP15, parties adopted 26 headline indicators to track the goals and targets of the KMGBF alongside an additional 230 indicators to use at a national level.

4. Since the turn of the century, [mining has increased by 52% due to surging demand for coal, iron, industrial minerals and other metals](https://www.wri.org/insights/how-mining-impacts-forests). In some cases, this extraction has come at the expense of forests, along with burdens to the communities who rely on them. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares of trees from mining and related activities. Although mining's role in global tree cover loss is small compared to the main drivers (for example, 130 million hectares were lost due to forestry and 90 million hectares from wildfire between 2001 and 2020). Of the 1.4 million hectares of mining-related tree cover loss from 2001 to 2020, 450,000 hectares were in tropical primary rainforests, 150,000 hectares were in protected areas, and 260,000 hectares were in Indigenous Peoples' and local community lands. Mining-related loss in tropical primary rainforests is especially concerning because these are some of the most carbon-rich and biodiverse areas of the world, and also help regulate local and regional climate effects like rainfall and temperatures.

5. [The Solomon Islands has taken a critical step towards strenghtening the legality and sustainability of its international wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/solomon_islands_moves_to_improve_legal_acquisition_findings_for_international_wildlife_trade). The Solomon Islands relies on international trade in a large number of coral species, parrots and other bird species as a vital source of income. Ensuring this trade is conducted in a legal and sustainable manner is essential not only for conserving the Islands' terrestrial and marine biodiversity, but also for safeguarding the livelihoods of communities that depend on these natural resources. 

6. Planet, ERM, Salesforce and NatureMetrics launched the NatureTech Alliance to help companies harness advanced data and technology to tackle their most urgent nature challenges. They [released](https://www.planet.com/pulse/the-tools-to-move-from-do-no-harm-to-nature-positive-planet-and-partners-release-report-at-cop16/) a [new report with insights from leading companies about their nature performance journeys](https://www.erm.com/insights/the-nature-tech-revolution-the-tools-to-move?utm_source=Planet&utm_medium=all&utm_campaign=Nature%20Tech%20Revolution), and identified key steps to move from 'do no harm' to 'nature-positive' through thoughtful and timely integration of data and tech, and show how leading performers are on their way. 

7. [Citizens can contribute towards more than half of hte data to track progress on global biodiversity goals](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/citizens-can-contribute-towards-more-than-half-of-data-to-track-progress-on-global-biodiversity-goals). A new [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01447-y), published in Nature Sustainability, quantifies how citizens can help to monitor progress towards achieving the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. It defines 'citizen involvement' as referring to the participation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and other citizen groups. It was found that these groups could improve the collection of 51% of the data needed as well as improve the analysis as well as the collection of 30% of the information needed. The greatest opportunities for citizens to contribute and interpret data are on targets to reduce threats to biodiversity and to meet peoples' needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing from biodiversity.

**Climate**
1. [COP29: yearbook of global climate action highlights significant strides by cities, businesses, and civil society as non-State actors call on government to accelerate the pace at Baku](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/cop29-baku-global-climate-action-strides/). Significant advances of the last 12 months include a 14% increase in renewable energy capacity, a 70% increase of global investment in clean technology manufacturing since 2022, a 35% growth in zero-emission vehicle sales, a reduction of carbon intensity of 8% in the cement industry, and 103 agri-food businesses have established and validated science-based targets, which is an increase of more than 700% since 2023.

2. Carbon emission reduction plans designed by developed nations can, whether by intention or not, deny developing nations the opportunity to develop. [Balancing climate action with economic progress is critical to creating an inclusive, resilient future for all](https://sdg-action.org/climate-action-that-protects-the-right-to-development/). Industrialised countries, particularly the G20, bear the most responsibility, accounting for 80% of global CO2 emissions. Developing countries, especially small island developing states and least developed countries, are paying the highest price: they are losing lives and harvests. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, to end hunger and poverty, an economic growth of at least 7% per year in developing countries. The key question is: how can economic growth be decoupled from CO2 emissions? This year's COP must deliver on a truly ambitious climate finance goal after 2025.

3. [One quarter of the world's crops are grown in areas where the water supply is highly stressed, highly unreliable or both](https://www.wri.org/insights/growing-water-risks-food-crops). Mounting risks like climate change and increased competition for water are threatening water supplies and, in turn, food security. Rice, wheat and corn, which provide more than half the world's food calories, are particularly vulnerable: 33% of these three staple crops are produced using water supplies that are highly stressed or highly variable.

4. The [Copernicus Polar Roadmap](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/copernicus-polar-roadmap-service-evolution_en), which was presented at the 2024 EU Polar Science Week, outlines a [strategic approach for the evolution of the Copernicus Programme](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/how-copernicus-can-respond-emerging-polar-challenges) to address the significant environmental, climatic, and geopolitical challenges emerging in the polar regions, particularly the Arctic and Antarctic, which are increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, such as ice melt and changes in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The Arctic is warming at about four times faster than the global average, causing rapid sea ice loss, glacier retreat, and a cascade of environmental consequences that have global and regional implications. Additionally, the Arctic is gaining geopolitical attention as the melting ice opens new sea routes and economic opportunities, such as fishing, tourism, and resource extraction. The Copernicus Polar Roadmap introduces several key components to guide Copernicus service development in the polar regions over the next 5-10 years, and includes three main segments: recommendations for the evolution of Copernicus services; recommendations on specific service elements and cross-cutting activities; and recommendations on observations with a focus on the in situ component.

5. The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 1.1 calls for eradicating poverty for all people everywhere. Similarly, the World Bank has a goal to reduce extreme poverty to less than 3% of the global population by 2030. At the same time, if growth rates remain as they are today, greenhouse gas emisions will continue to increase global temperatures to levels with devastating and irreversible consequences. Therefore, [business-as-usual policies will not bring us closer to achieving the goals of eradicating poverty and addressing climate change](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/global-poverty-and-climate-goals-will-remain-out-of-reach-with-b). 

6. As climate disasters intensify worldwide, a [unique online course](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/new-online-course-shows-how-nature-can-help-us-adapt-to-climate-change), '[Bringing nature into national adaptation planning](https://bit.ly/4fd5PEB)' is helping countries to rethink their national adaptation plans to harness the power of nature. This course aims to help all those involved in national adaptation planning take better account of nature and its role in building resilience to climate change. So far, 57 countries have submitted a Nature Adaptation Plan, outlining their vulnerabilities to climate change and plans to address its impacts. However, many NAPs overlook the vital role of nature in adaptation, and the risks if nature is not considered in the decision-making process.

**Oceans**
1. The newly [released](https://oceandecade.org/news/ambition-action-impact-new-flagship-report-outlines-ocean-decade-priorities-to-2030/) report '[Ambition, action, impact: the ocean decade pathway to 2030 - consolidated outcomes of the Vision 2030 Process](https://oceandecade.org/publications/ambition-action-impact-the-ocean-decade-pathway-to-2030-consolidated-outcomes-of-the-vision-2030-process/) identifies key priorities and transformative actions to advance ocean knowledge and science as part of the Ocean Decade. A set of high-level priorities, including tackling marine pollution, advancing ecosystem-based management, and exploring deep-sea biodiversity, for ocean science and knowledge over the coming years that look at the interactions between the Ocean Challenges and the enabling conditions that need to be established or strengthened to ensure that relevant and timely science and knowledge is generated and used for decision making. The main sources of marine pollution originate form land-based activities such as agricultural, urban, and domestic discharges, as well as mining and industrial operations. [Six key actions to address marine pollutions](https://www.renewablematter.eu/en/marine-pollution-the-first-challenge-of-the-Ocean-Decade) were proposed in the first [Challenge](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390116?posInSet=1&queryId=d61fb5dd-1226-4649-a508-7dd636d457fe): 1: filling the knowledge gaps and lack of data, 2: generating and sharing knowledge, 3: addressing the lack of necessary infrastructure, 4: creating partnerships at multiple levels, 5: building capacity and 6: development of innovative and technological solutions.

2. The Marine Stewardship Council has launched [a new initiative](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2024/10/29/msc-launches-its-improvement-program) aimed at accelerating progress in sustainable fishing practices worldwide. Although over 500 fisheries have been certified according to the MSC's rigorous [Fisheries Standard](https://www.msc.org/standards-and-certification/fisheries-standard), nearly 38% of global fish stocks are now overfished. The [new MSC Improvement Program](https://www.msc.org/what-we-are-doing/improvement-program) seeks to address this by offering fisheries support and incentives, provided they make measurable improvements over a five-year period.

3. Two significant tuna fisheries, Western Central Pacific Ocean skipjack and North Pacific albacore have achieved [major milestones in sustainable fisheries management by successfully implementing rigorous harvest strategies](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2024/10/23/landmark-achievements-in-tuna-fisheries-wcpo-skipjack-and-north-pacific-albacore-implement-world-leading-harvest-strategies) that ensure the long-term health of these tuna stocks. Harvest strategies are vital to ensuring stocks are managed sustainably, and this is particularly important for stocks such as tuna, which migrate across vast distances and are shared by multiple nations. 

4. [Ocean solutions for biodiversity: how the ocean decade is contributing to a sustainable and resilient future](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-solutions-for-biodiversity-how-the-ocean-decade-is-contributing-to-a-sustainable-and-resilient-future/). The Ocean Decade released '[An Ocean of Life: How the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development is Supporting Implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391687)', showcasing how targeted initiatives under the Ocean Decade are advancing the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework through transformative ocean actions. Especially Challenge 2 of the ten Decade Challenges addresses the biodiversity-relevant aspects of ocean science and knowledge, aiming to enhance our understanding of ocean ecosystem changes and foster global cooperation for sustainable ocean management, in line with GBF targets.

5. The [Ocean State Report 8 is a flagship report](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/deeper-look-ocean-state-report-8), providing a comprehensive overview of the current state, ongoing trends and natural variations of the ocean, published by the Copernicus Marine Service. The report serves as a compendium of 19 peer-reviewed studies and is intended to act as a reference, providing a unique ocean monitoring dashboard for the scientific community and for policy makers and others with decision making responsibilities. An [interactive summary for policymakers](https://indd.adobe.com/view/9ebd815a-d54c-4797-bf0c-e45185f863b0) highlights the main findings of the report, trends, and variations in ocean monitoring indicators. The report is divided into four chapters, 1: the state of the ocean, 2: updated and new pathways in ocean science, 3: ocean state and change for relevance to society and 4: specific events in the ocean in 2022.

6. A new report, [Tides for Transparency](https://www.hubocean.earth/tides-of-transparency-a-first-mapping-of-industrial-ocean-biodiversity-data-sharing), reveals that [only 3% of global ocean biodiversity data comes from the private sector](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/unveiling-major-opportunity-for-private-sector-to-boost-ocean-biodiversity-knowledge), and urges industries to contribute crucial information to accelerate sustainable ocean management. The assessment, conducted on two of the largest global biodiversity repositories, the Ocean Biodiversity Information System and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, sheds light on the fragmented nature of private sector contributions. In some regions, private sector contributions are as high as 30-50% (with regional leaders being Namibia, Portugal, Japan and Colombia), indicating a significant potential for surpassing the 3% mark. However, key industries such as offshore oil and gas, renewables and maritime activities remain underrepresented in ocean biodiversity sharing.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) [announced the launch](https://earthobservations.org/news/global-ecosystems-atlas-unveiled-transform-ecosystems-stewardship) of the proof-of-concept of the [Global Ecosystems Atlas](https://earthobservations.org/news/globalecosystemsatlas.org), the first harmonised resource dedicated to mapping and monitoring all the world's ecosystems, at COP16. The Global Ecosystems Atlas will serve as an essential tool to support the protection, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems critical to addressing global environmental crises. Policymakers, financial institutions, private companies and even local communities can use the Atlas to make informed decisions, support sustainability and manage risks.

2. [AllSource analysis transforms Planet data into actionable intelligence for governments and enterprises](https://www.planet.com/pulse/allsource-analysis-transforms-planet-data-into-actionable-intelligence-for-governments-and-enterprises/), by integrating satellite data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and human expertise into finished geospatial intelligence. Their comprehensive reports provide crucial insights for timely decisions affecting infrastructure, resources, and lives in cases of conflict, natural disasters and unexpected challenges. 

3. [Switzerland 2075](https://www.nzz.ch/english/switzerland-in-2075-a-climate-change-visualization-ld.1855325): visualising climate change. One of the most visited media sites in Switzerland, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, has produced a remarkable, immersive experience [showing what the Swiss landscape could look like if climate change continues at the current rate](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/11/switzerland-2075-visualising-climate-change/). Maptiler played a pivotal role in Switzerland 2075 by providing essential map tools and resources to create a dynamic, data-driven visualisation to highlight real-world changes to the landscape.

2. [African CITES Parties urged to modernise permitting systems to support legal and traceable trade and combat wildlife crime](https://cites.org/eng/news/ecites-africa-regional-workshop-nairobi-2024). By digitising the process of issuing, tracking, and verifying trade permits, e-permitting systems streamline trade procedures, replacing traditional paper permits with more secure, efficient digital alternatives. Electronic permitting systems increase transparency, automate statistical reporting, and help prevent the issuance of fraudulent permits and certificates. They also strengthen collaboration with customs and border agencies, by streamlining border control, permit endorsements, and verification processes. Additionally, electronic systems facilitate the seamless exchange of permit information between CITES Parties, promoting more efficient and secure international cooperation for sustainable, legal and traceable wildlife trade.

**Biodiversity**
1. [Catastrophic 73% decline in the average size of global wildlife populations in just 50 years reveals a 'system in peril'](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/catastrophic-73-decline-in-the-average-size-of-global-wildlife-populations-in-just-50-years-reveals-a-system-in-peril). WWF published their [Living Planet Report 2024](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/), which warns that parts of our planet are approaching dangerous tipping points driven by the combination of nature loss and climate change, which pose grave threats to humanity. Regional tipping points, such as the decimation of North American pine forests, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the mass die-off of coral reefs, have the potential to create shockwaves far beyond the immediate region, impacting food security, livelihoods and economies. The Living Planet Index tracks almost 35,000 vertebrate populations of 5,495 species, from 1970 to 2020. The steepest decline is found in freshwater populations (85%), followed by terrestrial (69%) and marine (56%) species. The dominant threats to wildlife populations are habitat loss and degradation and overharvesting, which is primarily driven by our global food system. 

2. [New analysis reveals countries are falling short on nature pledges ahead of CBD COP16](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-analysis-reveals-countries-are-falling-short-on-nature-pledges-ahead-of-cbd-cop16). WWF revealed that the majority of countries are not fully honouring their commitments to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030 in [their review of countries' National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs)](https://wwf.panda.org/act/nbsap_tracker_check_your_countrys_nature_progress/). With only 10% of countries having submitted national plans since COP15, [WWFs NBSAP Tracker](https://wwf.panda.org/act/nbsap_tracker_check_your_countrys_nature_progress/) also assesses national targets published by 33% of countries. Many of the plans that have been published seem to omit clear and consistent ways of measuring progress, which could indicate a lack of accountability during the implementation of the plans, which was one of the key failings of the Aichi Targets from 2011-2020. As of August 2024, 17.5% of Earth's terrestrial and inland waters are protected or conserved, alongside 8.5% of the ocean. [Key to this is how countries measure the effectiveness of protected and conserved areas](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-much-progress-have-we-made-towards-global-ambitions-on-protected-areas): how well managed they are, whether they are equitably governed and whether they are delivering good conservation outcomes. 

3. Tropical forests are the most biodiverse forests on the planet and have historically been significant carbon sinks. Deforestation, extreme weather and wildfires are turning some regions into carbon sources. However, this reversal is not uniform; different evolutionary histories and enormous heterogeneity in environmental conditions and human interactions underpin potentially significant variation in tropical forest resilience: there are major knowledge gaps which urgently need to be filled. [Pangea, the PAN tropical investigation of bioGeochemistry and Ecological Adaptation](https://tropicalforestscoping.com/), aims to focus on the following objectives: characterise and quantify heterogeneous tropical forest responses to anthropogenic changes; constrain model uncertainty of future tropical carbon flux predictions by improving process understanding and advancing remote sensing data-model integration; and address calibration, validation, and algorithm development needs to ensure measurements can be accurately retrieved from satellite remote sensing datasets. PANGEA is one of two NASA funded efforts to scope a 6- to 9-year multi-scale campaign. The [draft white paper is open to comments](https://cce.nasa.gov/terrestrial_ecology/pdfs/PANGEA_Draft_White_Paper.pdf) (using [the scoping study feedback survey](https://cce-signin.gsfc.nasa.gov/limesurvey/PANGEA)) until the 5th of November. 

4. [WWF's Markets Institute kicked off Codex Planetarius and the 1% solution](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-program-could-put-an-end-to-global-environmental-destruction-for-food-production), which aims to rewrite the future of food production by supporting the growing demand for globally traded food while minimising the negative environmental consequences. When fully developed and launched, Codex Planetarius will provide a baseline for environmental performance in global production and trade of food and soft commodities, inform regulatory guidelines for governments and global trade that would apply to international trade agreements, and provide much-needed data to improve supply chain transparency and traceability. Food production has the largest impact of any human activity on the planet, and is responsible for 70% of biodiversity loss and up to 35% of global GHG emissions. The 1% solution would add a 1% environmental service payment to the price of food exports. For consumers, this increase in raw material prices would have an insignificant effect on the price of finished goods, but worldwide, the 1% environmental service payment would be enough to address the most significant impacts of producing food. 

5. The Royal Thai Government has released a new national wild tiger population estimate of 179-223 individuals. The previous estimate was between 148 and 189 tigers, and the increase makes [Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia to increase its wild tiger population](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/thailand-s-tigers-recovering-investment-in-conservation-leads-to-increase-in-tiger-numbers). Significant investment in the country's ranger workforce which patrol national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and the institutionalisation of [SMART (the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool)](https://tigers.panda.org/news_and_stories/stories/the_smart_way_to_protect_tiger_landscapes/), has improved the protection of tiger habitat and reduced poaching. 

6. [Protecting the invisible guardians of biodiversity and ecosystems](https://www.besnet.world/protecting-the-invisible-guardians-of-biodiversity-and-ecosystems/). This year's International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples focused on the protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact. For example, Indigenous Peoples in isolation are a vital part of the biocultural diversity of the Amazon region with its vast and intricate rainforest ecosystem. It is home to numerous Indigenous groups who have lived in relative isolation for centuries, as the Amazon's dense and remote environments have historically acted as a natural barrier, helping to protect these communities from external contact. The Convention on Biological Diversity defines them as 'native Indigenous populations who have voluntarily opted for a way of life separate from civilising contacts and modern society'. These communities face increasing threats from external pressures that jeopardise their ways of life and the conservation of their environments. Examples of these threats are the lack of specific protective laws, lack of information (missing protective data), illegal access to traditional knowledge and genetic material without free, prior and informed consent, illegal activities (timber extraction, poaching, armed actions, biotech research and ecotourism) and lack of legal and political representation.

7. [Next steps for conservation of animals in international trade proposed at CITES Animals Committee meeting](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/next-steps-for-conservation-of-animals-in-international-trade-proposed-ac33). Sustainably managing sharks, rays, snakes, big cats and other fauna in international trade requires scientific collaboration to monitor the conservation needs of species in the wild. This involves making scientific assessments of the impacts of trade on species and their roles in the ecosystem, considering their diverse contributions to community livelihoods and ensuring that cross-border trade is not detrimental to their continued existence in the wild. For the first time in CITES history, sharks and rays and reptiles were included in the [Review of Significant Trade](https://cites.org/eng/imp/sigtradereview). For big cats, the Committee acknowledged the importance of information sharing between leopard range States, discussed the development of work programs and an intergovernmental platform to support jaguar conservation, and highlighted an ongoing comparative study of lian management across range States.

8. A [systematic review based on 662 studies on site-level biodiversity conservation, spanning 50 years of conservation has been published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-024-02049-w) in Ambio. In these studies, knowledge production about the Global South was largely produced by researchers in the Global North. The relationships in the sample studies between conservation initiative types, the extent of Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' influence in governance, and social and ecological outcomes were reported. It was found that positive ecological and social outcomes are strongly associated with higher levels of influence of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their institutions, implying equity in conservation practice should be advanced not only for moral reasons, but because it can enhance conservation effectiveness.

9. Besides the crucial benefits for the health of the planet, plants also provide a range of benefits for the livelihoods of people; African cherry is traditionally used for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions, rosewood is used as high-value timber for furniture and musical instruments and edible tuberous orchids hold cultural significance for their use in traditional teas and desserts. The trade and harvest of these plants must be well-regulated to ensure their use remains sustainable, results in long term benefits to the people and species involved and maintain the role that the species play in the ecosystem. During the [27th meeting of the Plants Committee of CITES](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/cites-plants-committee-agrees-on-actions-to-support-conservation-and-sustainable-trade-pc27), several draft decisions and recommendations regarding orchids were agreed by the Committee for submission to CoP20, and the Committee agreed to export quotas for a limited number of rosewood specimens for countries that demonstrated that the proposed trade will be sustainable. At a side event, progress for African rosewood was further magnified with the launch of the [first global report on CITES rosewood tree species](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/new-guidance-to-protect-priority-rosewood-species-in-trade-ac33), aiming to provide data and insights into the status and trade trends of rosewood species worldwide, and expected to serve as a vital resource for policymakers and conservationists.

10. Countries must respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities to achieve the world's major international commitment on biodiversity. This includes acknowledging Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' rights to nature and their contributions to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Monitoring how their rights are realised is crucial. [Indicators enable national governments and stakeholders to measure how Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' knowledge and practices are impacting and being integrated into national efforts for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/remarkable-progress-made-towards-incorporating-traditional-knowledge-into-the-biodiversity-plan). There are four key traditional knowledge indicators that relate to Indigenous Peoples' collective rights: Trends in linguistic diversity and numbers of speakers of Indigenous languages; Trends in land-use change and land tenure in the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; Trends in the practice of traditional occupations; and Trends in the degree to which traditional knowledge and practices are respected. 

11. A [study revealed that insects were the first pollinators of flowing plants](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.18993), for more than 85 percent of their evolutionary past, highlighting the long history of interactions between insects and angiosperms. Using a robust, dated phylogeny of angiosperms code with pollination modes at the species level, [researchers behind this study set out to reconstruct the evolution of angiosperm pollination and quantify timing and drivers of shifts in modes](https://www.gbif.org/data-use/6dyOw9ZpopI8f9Nh7KIJkf/insects-the-original-pollinators-of-flowering-plants). The analysis revealed far more transitions to wind from animal pollination than the reverse, and species with high habitat openness were 20 per cent more likely to be pollinated by animals, whereas wind pollination increased with distance from the equator. 

12. [Forest fires are getting worse](https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires?utm_medium=referral+&utm_source=GFWBlog&utm_campaign=GFWBlog%22target=%22_blank), more widespread and burning at least twice as much tree cover today as they did two decades ago. From 2001 to 2023, the area burned by forest fires increased by about 5.4% per year. Forest fires now result in nearly 6 million more hectares of tree cover loss per year than in 2001. While fires accounted for about 20% of all tree cover loss in 2001, they now account for roughly 33%.

13. [Data is helping protect threatened forests and biodiversity in Cameroon's Mengamé Gorilla Sanctuary](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/data-protect-cameroon-mengame-gorilla-sanctuary/). Cameroon's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan calls for at least 30% of the national territory to be designated as protected areas. To this end, several protected areas were established, including the Mengamé Gorilla Sanctuary, which faces several threats including the loss of forest cover and poaching. Satellite data were used to identify areas of tree cover loss, and investigation of the identified areas showed the establishment or extension of cocoa and banana plantations. A survey was conducted to uncover the motivations of the local communities to conduct agricultural practices in the sanctuary, and discovered that 38% of the population thinks they are not involved in the management of the sanctuary and that the space dedicated to the communities' rural activities became insufficient. This information could be used for a new management plan. 

14. Central Asian countries are coming together to prevent the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases by strengthening their protected area networks. Two years ago, scientists found ancient DNA samples in Kyrgyzstan that indicated that the Black Death made the jump from rodents into humans in the foothills of the Tian Shan mountains in the early 14th century. It is now widely thought that the world's earliest-recorded and deadliest pandemic emerged in Central Asia, then spread across Asia, Europe and North Africa, killing nearly 60% of the population. Most new, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases originate in animals. The One Health in nature conservation in Central Asia initiative aims to create [space for nature and lead to larger more resilient populations of wild animals](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/stronger-protected-areas-will-boost-human-health-in-central-asia) that interact less often with livestock and humans, which should reduce the emergence of zoonotic diseases.
    
15. The theme of the World Migratory Bird Day, on the 12th of October (in 2024 there were 2 World Migratory Bird Days, on the 11th of May and the 12th of October, reflecting the cyclical nature of seasonal bird migrations in different hemispheres), [highlighted the importance of insects for migratory birds](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2716), and calls more action to protect decreasing populations of insects, by reducing use of pesticides and fertilisers as well as encouraging organic farming. Insects significantly affect the timing, duration and overall success of bird migrations. Insect populations have declined dramatically in recent decades as a result of the use of insecticides and the destruction of their habitats linked to agricultural intensification, urbanisation and road development. Climate change and biological invasions also cause the death of insects by starvation, disease or predation. 

16. Since traditional conservation methods face new limitations, the [need for technological advancements has never been greater](https://iucnsos.org/embracing-technology-for-improved-wildlife-conservation/). Tools like drones, camera traps and remote sensing are providing unprecedented insights into species behaviour, population dynamics and habitat use, allowing conservationists to respond more effectively to threats. One of the four projects described took place in Mauritius, where drones equipped with thermal cameras were used to monitor and assess the population size of the endangered Mauritian flying fox, while also evaluating the characteristics of their roosts and their impact on commercial fruit crops. Thermal images were used to estimate and track colony sizes, factors influencing roost quality and seasonal changes. Additionally, drones were used to observe bat activity in fruit orchards to measure the extent of crop damage and test the effectiveness of non-lethal deterrent methods. 

17. The latest data from the University of Maryland provides a detailed view of how fires have driven tree cover loss across the globe in 2023. The tree cover loss from fires data builds on the existing annual tree cover loss data. Each 30-m pixel in the annual tree cover loss data is analysed using Landsat satellite images to determine whether the loss was likely due to stand-replacing fires (which kill all or most living trees). Using this data, [detailed patterns of tree cover loss due to fires can be assessed over a 23-year period using globally consistent definition of fire-driven forest loss](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/trends-tree-loss-from-fires-unprecedented-detail/). Canada, Russia and Brazil had the most tree cover loss due to fires in 2023. 

**Climate**
1. [Global drought report highlights urgent need for action to protect ecosystems, agriculture and livelihoods](https://earthobservations.org/news/may-2024-global-drought-report-highlights-urgent-need-action-protect-ecosystems-agriculture-and-livelihoods). The global drought scenario in May 2024 underscores the urgent need for comprehensive monitoring and mitigation efforts to address the widespread and multifaceted impacts of drought conditions on ecosystems, agriculture and human livelihoods. Low soil moisture and groundwater levels continue to plague significant agricultural areas, especially in the Americas, Africa, eastern Europe and parts of Asia, severe food and water shortages were reported in Zimbabwe, affecting half the population and a study in Nature Communications revealed that Brazil's Cerrado is experiencing its worst drought in 700 years.

2. Extreme heat, often defined by metrics and indicators including temperature, humidity, wind and solar radiation, is a daily reality for many urban residents, but developing cost-effective resilience strategies is often a timely, expensive process, while citizens need immediate solutions. [Developing impactful urban heat solution requires the translation of local heat stress metrics into actionable insights: cities should select a heat stress metrics](https://earthobservations.org/news/bridging-heat-resilience-gap-how-empower-urban-decision-makers) based on their budget, audience and available data; develop heat-risk maps that incorporate local climate, urban morphology and socioeconomic factors to develop the levels of risk across the city as a basis of prioritising when and where to act; and ensure that these heat risk maps and information are clear, understandable and usable for policymakers.

**Oceans**
1. All [10 white papers for the different challenges of the Ocean Decade Vision 2030 are published on the UNESCO website](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/search/46976432-b9ce-4653-a197-3d63dff27ec7). The second white paper focuses on the importance of [protecting and restoring marine ecosystems and biodiversity](https://www.renewablematter.eu/en/restoring-marine-ecosystems-the-second-challenge-of-the-ocean-decade), and aims to identify gaps and priorities for establishing key indicators essential to achieve the Ocean Decade 'Challenge 2' by 2030. Therefore, the effects of multiple stressors on ocean ecosystems and developing solutions to monitor, protect, manage and restore ecosystems and their biodiversity in the context of environmental, social and climate change should be understood. Factors such as pollution, the climate crisis and other anthropogenic activities may alter the composition of marine species and organisms over time, creating uncertainty about the availability of fish stocks and ecosystem services, making predictions over longer periods extremely complex. Due to the lack of data, it is unclear which ecosystems can be restored. To address these issues and to understand the dynamic changes in marine life, strategic data collection has been identified as a key element in achieving the Ocean Decade challenge goals. The other challenges are marine pollution (WG1); sustainably nourish the global population (WG3); develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy (WG4); unlock ocean-based solutions to climate change (WG5); increase community resilience to ocean hazards (WG6); [sustainably expand the Global Ocean Observing System (WG7)](https://goosocean.org/news/un-ocean-decade-challenge-7-white-paper-a-roadmap-for-the-observing-system-we-need/); create a digital representation of the ocean (WG8); skills, knowledge, technology and participatory decision-making for all (WG9); and restoring society's relationship with the ocean (WG10).  

2. [The community of Cahuita, a community on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, celebrated their Tsunami Ready recognition ceremony](https://oceandecade.org/news/cahuita-in-costa-rica-is-tsunami-ready/), joining 10 other communities on Costa Rica's Pacific coast that have been recognised since 2017. To achieve this, there are 12 requirements in tsunami assessment, preparedness and response, including a tsunami evacuation map, deployment of tsunami evacuation route signs, outreach activities and a tsunami evacuation drill. 

3. Scientists are warning that [exploitable fish biomass faces climate risks across nearly all regions of the world's ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/climate-risks-project-steep-falls-in-fish-biomass-around-worlds-ocean/), including top producer countries and those with a high reliance on aquatic foods, under a high-emissions scenario, according to a [report by the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd1379en). Under the low-emissions scenario, changes stabilise between no change and a decrease of 10% or less across 178 countries and territories by the end of the century. Under a high-emissions scenario, declines will worsen by the end of the century, to 30% or greater in 48 countries and territories. 

4. In the face of increasing threats to coral ecosystems and the recent announcement of the fourth global coral bleaching event, the Global Fund for Coral Reefs Executive Board has announced a [total of over $25 million USD in additional grant funding to scale up resilience efforts across coral nations](https://oceandecade.org/news/gfcr-approves-more-than-25-million-usd-in-additional-funding-for-resilience-action/).

5. UNESCO announced [15 awards for young researchers](https://oceandecade.org/news/unesco-announces-15-awards-for-young-researchers-working-in-biosphere-reserves/) working in biosphere reserves, with a focus on marine, island and coastal issues. 

6. The Pacific region is among the most impacted in the world by climate change. [Indigenous Pacific Islanders with disabilities are particularly at risk](https://oceandecade.org/news/rising-tides-raising-voices-the-crucial-fight-for-disability-inclusive-climate-justice-in-the-pacific/). They are less likely to be formally employed, and their livelihoods depend on fishing and farming. During disasters, the structural barriers that Pacific Islanders with disabilities face, like the lack of accessible information and transportation, can become a death sentence. Disabled grassroots activists across the Pacific are championing disability-inclusive climate action. In June 2023, the Disability Justice Project began filming '[Rising Tides, Raising Voices](https://disabilityjusticeproject.org/film/rising-tides-raising-voices/)' as part of a training program in Samoa exploring the intersection of climate change, disability, and Indigeneity in the Pacific. 

7. [The Copernicus Marine Service empowers maritime safety by safeguarding our sea](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-empowers-maritime-safety-safeguarding-our-sea) with data needed to forecast ocean and coastal currents, which are vital for maritime safety, search and rescue operations, and environmental protection in Spanish waters. A forecasting system has been developed that predicts hourly ocean conditions, including surface currents, in the Bay of Biscay. These forecasts are essential for tracking the movements of people, vessels, and potential hazards, thereby improving search and rescue operations. 

8. [4 Innovative applications of Copernicus Marine data](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/can-we-have-healthy-ocean-4-innovative-applications-using-marine-data) for a healthy ocean, by improving coastal management, promoting sustainable practices, and ultimately, safeguarding the health of our oceans. 1) In Lisbon the data has been used to provide a high-resolution model of hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry to support water quality assessments, which are essential for environmental management and blue economy sectors and maintaining optimal nutrient conditions. 2) In Romania a warning system for land-based pollution in the Romanian coastal area was developed, maintaining seafood safety and ensuring public health and aligning with EU environmental priorities and regulations. 3) The Tagus estuary, located in Lisbon, faces significant water quality challenges due to intensive human activities and rising sea levels. Copernicus Marine data was used to develop advanced model-based predictions with real-time observations to provide essential data on physical (e.g. waves, currents, water levels) and biogeochemical (e.g. nutrients, chlorophyll-a) aspects. 4) Data was used to access ongoing hydrodynamic data and trend analysis, which are essential for maintaining a good environmental state in accordance with the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the southern North Sea. This busy and shallow shelf sea welcomes many activities such as shipping, fishing and tourism, all of which add pressure to the environment. This service provides continuous insight into trends of key hydrodynamic parameters such as currents, waves, water temperature, and salinity, including stratification of the latter two, which are critical for sustainable marine management. 

9. The Estonian Coastal Monitoring and Forecast Service used Copernicus Marine data to play a key role in [improving energy security in the Baltic Sea](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/empowering-decisions-coastal-zones-copernicus-marine-service) by providing state-of-the-art metocean data for the planning and construction of liquefied natural gas terminals. The comprehensive oceanographic and meteorological data critical to liquefied natural gas terminals and pipelines include parameters such as waves, sea level, currents, and ice conditions, presented as both baseline statistics and extreme event forecasts. This represents a significant step forward in the development of a robust and environmentally responsible natural gas infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

10. [Almost £1 million awarded to fishery improvements and research projects through the MSC’s Ocean Stewardship Fund for 2023-2024](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2024/07/25/500-000-gbp-awarded-to-fishery-research-projects-through-msc-ocean-stewardship-fund). Thirteen projects, associated with wild-capture fisheries in Mexico, Nicaragua, Suriname, Peru, South Africa, India, Indonesia and New Zealand were funded. By making improvements to their fishing practices, they aim to meet the MSC Fisheries Standard for environmental sustainability. The research scientists who received these grants are focused on gaining more insight around the population dynamics of target stocks. Through the research, fisheries can be more informed on the abundance of the stocks they harvest and ensure rules are in place to better manage catch limits and harvest at sustainable rates. Additionally, four Student Research Grants were awarded to early career researchers, aiming to aid fisheries in minimising their impacts on biodiversity and the wider marine ecosystem. 

11. The Fishing Vessel Observing Network (FVON), Surface Ocean CO2 Observing Network (SOCONET) and Science Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications (SMART) Subsea Cables are [three new emerging networks aiming to grow and contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System by providing sustained and interoperable ocean data to fill known gaps](https://goosocean.org/news/three-emerging-observing-networks-join-the-global-ocean-observing-system/), by collaborating with fishers, integrating the variety of surface CO2 monitoring platforms and maximising the societal benefits of subsea infrastructure, respectively.

12. [New use cases highlight critical role of seabed mapping in driving ocean sustainability and innovation](https://oceandecade.org/news/new-use-cases-highlight-critical-role-of-seabed-mapping-in-driving-ocean-sustainability-and-innovation/), showcasing the indispensable role of seabed mapping in addressing some of the world's most pressing marine and maritime challenges, by addressing pressing global issues such as climate change mitigation, marine biodiversity protection and Blue Economy development. They also ensure that seabed mapping efforts are targeted to support ocean sustainability, policy development and economic growth. The [twelve use cases](https://seabed2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SEABED-2030-Compendium-of-Seabed-Mapping-Use-Cases-031024.pdf) cover key areas such as climate change, marine biodiversity, disaster management and marine spatial planning. All data collected and shared with the Seabed 2030 project is included in the free and publicly available GEBCO global grid.

13. [New research](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10715) suggests that people's 'marine identity' (an identity rooted in how the ocean as a place supports the sense of self) can help us [reset society's relationship with the seas and restore the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/marine-identity-can-help-restore-the-ocean/). Marine identity was discussed using testimonies and photos from multiple countries, and common themes including traditions and customs and the dependency on the ocean for recreation, livelihoods, health and sustenance were found. Negative identities were found for communities and people whose livelihoods are at risk from extreme weather. Identity drives people more than values, and people react to threats to their sense of self. As a result, marine identity could have a powerful impact on protecting and restoring the ocean. 

14. During the most recent Ocean Census expedition, [scientists identified 20 potentially new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/20-suspected-new-marine-species-arise-from-sois-nazca-ridge-expedition/) on the Nazca Ridge, an underwater mountain range located 900 miles off the coast of Chile. 

15. [The third annual progress report 'Progress towards shipping's 2030 breakthrough](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Climate-action-in-shipping-Progress-towards-shippings-2030-breakthrough-2024-ed.pdf) warns that the majority of actors across the maritime ecosystem - which spans the five 'system change levers' of supply, demand, policy, finance and civil society - are moving too slowly to meet the internationally-agreed target, with the [next 12 months being critical to avoid shipping falling irreparably behind its climate goals](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/shipping-2030-breakthrough-third-progress-report/?_gl=1*nmdou2*_ga*NDA5MTg0NDcyLjE3MDk1NjU5MTU.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTcyODgzNzMxNi41LjAuMTcyODgzNzM5NC4wLjAuMA..). Of the 35 actions required to deliver the 2030 breakthrough, just eight are considered to be on track, while 13 have been classed as 'off track'.  In last year's edition, eight actions were classed as 'off track'. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. Digital Earth Africa has announced the launch of its [innovative Waterbodies Monitoring Service](https://earthobservations.org/news/digital-earth-africa-unveils-major-advancement-observation-africas-waterbodies). The service provides previously unseen levels of access to data that can be used to assess and monitor surface water across the entire African continent. It tracks data from more than 700,000 unique water bodies across Africa, incorporating over 40 years of satellite observations. The Waterbodies Monitoring Service can be accessed via an API through the Digital Earth Africa [interactive maps platform](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/#share=s-gPyGXT9sd2dWOY9cdyvPmJuQQgJ) and the [sandbox analytical environment](https://sandbox.digitalearth.africa/hub/login).

A new database, developed by the Global Dam Watch consortium, is set to [revolutionise our understanding of river barriers and reservoirs worldwide](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-database-provides-world-s-most-comprehensive-data-on-river-barriers-and-reservoirs). The database, [GDW database](https://www.globaldamwatch.org/database), integrates existing global datasets to provide the most comprehensive and globally consistent resource for large-scale analyses to date. Existing global datasets are often created from national or basin scale inputs, making them inconsistent and unreliable for global analyses. The GDW database aims to address this issue by bringing together existing global datasets to create a single globally consistent repository of instream barriers and reservoirs and their attributes. Version 1.0 of the GDW database contains 41,145 barrier locations and 32,295 associated reservoir polygons. These barriers represent a cumulative storage capacity of 7,420 km3 and an artificial terrestrial surface water area of 304,600 km2. 

4. Building essential infrastructure is crucial as the world works towards ambitious sustainability goals. Estimates indicate that 70% of the infrastructure needed by 2050 has not been built yet. The impact of unsustainable infrastructure development ranges from degradation of natural habitats and deforestation, to illegal mining and wildfires. Additionally it contributes to higher levels of air, soil, and water pollution, disrupted terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, including negatively affecting ecosystem connectivity and wildlife migration. Each country has legal mechanisms to [identify and address the impacts of a proposed infrastructure project](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/the-crucial-role-for-data-in-developing-sustainable-infrastructure), and based on these assessments, a project may be accepted, rejected or amended to incorporate impact mitigation and avoidance strategies. However, without high-quality biodiversity data, these assessments can be ineffective. The [Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/) combines location-based data from protected areas, key biodiversity areas and species, maps potential biodiversity concerns and shares valuable insights for making better decisions through data. 

5. [Carbon Mapper releases first emissions (methane and CO2) detections from the Tanager-1 satellite](https://www.planet.com/pulse/carbon-mapper-releases-first-emissions-detections-from-the-tanager-1-satellite/). This is the culmination of years of effort to make emissions data available globally and actionable on a local scale. These observations are a preview of what's to come as Carbon Mapper will leverage Tanager-1 to scale-up emissions observations at unprecedented sensitivity across large areas. All methane and CO2 detections are publicly available for noncommercial use on the Carbon Mapper data portal. This data and data from other monitoring programs will be critical to helping governments deliver on the Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. It can also be transformative across major emitting sectors such as energy, waste and agriculture, empowering companies to identify and verify emissions reductions across their supply chains and deliver on stated commitments such as the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter.

**News and updates about applications**
1. [MapTiler Engine 13.4 has been released](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/08/intelligent-workflows-in-maptiler-engine-13-4/), which streamlines processing workflows, by providing several predefined workflows and preselecting the appropriate workflow based on the input data format, and by making it easier to convert data to tiles, merge tilesets and upload tilesets to the cloud.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [6th Open Science Train the Trainer Bootcamp](https://www.openaire.eu/6th-openaire-open-science-train-the-trainer-bootcamp) by OpenAIRE will be held from the 2nd to the 6th of December. The application deadline is on the 30th of October. 

2. [On the origin of academic traditions](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/origin-academic-traditions). Science aims to be objective, repeatable and justified in its choices and methods, which distinguishes accepted scientific sciences from pseudo-science. However, the experience of learning and working in the field of science, including graduate school activities and scientific conferences, might not always follow the same principles. At the 2022 American Geophysical Union meeting in Chicago, Illinois, participants were asked various different questions regarding alternative systems in earth science. The [results were recently published](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024CN000240) in the journal Perspectives of earth and space scientists. Additionally, the authors still [welcome input from the field with a survey](https://uchicago.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PPCLZAg2fRn2Wq) that remains open until the end of December 2025. 

3. [Connecting the dots with DataCite DOI metadata](https://datacite.org/blog/connecting-the-dots-with-datacite-doi-metadata/). DataCite provides services to register Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which provide a persistent way of identifying and accessing a particular resource. DataCite DOIs have metadata descriptions based on a comprehensive schema that includes 20 properties divided into mandatory, recommended, and optional elements, essential for ensuring that research outputs are easily found, accurately understood, and effectively linked within the research community. Key properties include an identifier, subject and publisher, better understanding and contextualization includes more properties: description, creator, title, publication year, resource type, funding references and rights. Using identifiers for people, such as ORCID iD, as well as identifiers for affiliations, funders and publishers, allows to connect people and organisations. Related identifiers link to related resources, such as publications, datasets, software and other outputs.

### Issue 4
Date: 4 July 2024

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Rangers from across the Southern African region have now established a new community of practice for monitoring and reporting on elephant mortality](https://cites.org/eng/news/empowering-data-driven-elephant-conservation-cites-mike-programme-ranger-training-sawc). Accurate and consistent data on elephant deaths is crucial for understanding and effectively addressing the threats faced by nature's gardeners, which include human=elephant conflict, habitat loss and the illegal killing for ivory. Reliable data allows for informed decision-making and effective conservation measures to ensure the long-term survival of African elephants in their natural habitats. 

2. [Two new studies show promising trends for Tanzania's rare creatures and protected habitats](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/studies-reveal-conservation-successes-for-wildlife-and-habitats-in-tanzania): regulations and management are having a positive impact on the trade of [chameleons](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300371) and [effectiveness of forest nature reserves](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281408) help to safeguard the east African country's rich biodiversity. Tanzania was the largest exporter of chameleons for the pet trade until 2016, when the export of all live wild-sourced animals was banned. For the second study, the effectiveness of 21 nature forest reserves (out of 26 in total, but there was no data available for the other 5) was measured with the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool, which uses input information on a range of social, environmental and economic issues and generates a score for a protected area, with a maximum of 99. The score rose from 55 in 2015 (for the 11 nature forest reserves for which data was available) to 87 (for 17 nature forest reserves), and over time the proportion of endemic species whose ranges were not covered by NFRs decreased: only 5% of endemic mammals' ranges did not fall under the protection of NFRs, and 10% of endemic reptiles' ranges.

3. Despite global commitments to halt deforestation by 2030, [only 8 of the top 20 countries with the highest rate of tropical deforestation have quantified targets on forests in their national climate action plans](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/national-climate-action-plans-have-insufficient-forest-targets-and-deforestation-continues-to-rise), also known ad Nationally Determined Contributions. The new UN-REDD report [Raising ambition, accelerating action: Towards enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions for forests](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/raising-ambition-accelerating-action-towards-enhanced-nationally-determined) reveals a major gap in forest protection, management and restoration in current NDCs, which outline plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change.

4. A new report, [Closing the Gap: investing in Natural Capital to meet the Sustainable Development Goals](https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT607) explores [how much 40 strategically chosen countries need to invest to meet key SDGs linked to nature conservation and restoration, more efficient use of natural resources and the reduction of water and air pollution](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/funding-nature-related-sustainable-development-goals-would-deliver-more-than-20-times-return-on-investment-study-shows). It then analyses the resulting return on investment in terms of benefits for nature and human wellbeing, calculated as an economic equivalent. It estimates that 7.4 trillion USD would need to be invested between now and 2030 to meet 9 key nature-related SDG targets, and closing the natural capital gap would generate the economic equivalent of 152 trillion USD (20 USD for every dollar spent). Meeting the targets would also avoid nearly 4.5 million premature deaths every year between now and 2030, avoid more than 27 million hectares of deforestation, reduced natural resource extraction by nearly 18 billion tonnes, restore more than 250 million hectares of agricultural land and increase terrestrial protected areas by 396,000 hectares and marine protected areas by 218,000 hectares.

5. The region of Asturias in [Northern Spain saw its largest single wildfire in recorded history in 2023](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/scientists-and-community-leaders-respond-one-spains-largest-fires-history), with a total of 10,096 hectares of land burned. A team of regional and national government forestry technicians, researchers, emergency service and forest service personnel and community members assessed changes in the soil and vegetation caused by fires. This data will be used for a more proactive approach to future fires.

6. GBIF is seeking [expert input](https://www.gbif.org/news/7uqv8Td2laX7Q4MMhCHEft/community-consultation-opens-for-freshwater-data-publishing-guide) and feedback from community members until the 15th of August 2024 to facilitate the release of a [new guide on the publishing of freshwater data](https://docs.gbif-uat.org/freshwater-data-publishing-guide/en/). The guide aims to describe best practices for formatting and publishing data derived from freshwater ecosystem sampling within the GBIF infrastructure.

7. [Europe's forests face increasing pressures](https://www.wri.org/insights/europe-forest-loss-drivers): climate change-induced wildfires, insect outbreaks and, most recently, increased wood harvesting to meet additional demand for 'home-grown' biomass in response to the Ukraine war and changing energy demands. Over the past two decades, the extent of Europe's tall forests (forests with trees taller than 15 metres) declined by 2.25 million hectares. Tall forests are critical for storing carbon and hosting biodiversity. When an area of tall forest is logged or burnt down, it will often regain tree cover from replanting or natural regeneration, however, the new trees can take decades to grow to the point where they provide the equivalent climate and ecosystem benefits of a mature forest, and ecosystem benefits may never be recovered in cases where only one or two species are planted in place of mature stands with a diversity of species. Europe's forests have been increasingly affected by insect outbreaks, due to global warming and poor forest management practices. In Germany, timber harvesting rates reportedly dropped by 10% from 2022 to 2023, but satellite data shows a 42% increase in tree cover loss in the same period, suggesting the loss was not related to harvesting. 

8. [Building resilient coastal communities through Nature-based Solutions and empowerment tools](https://www.es-partnership.org/building-resilient-coastal-communities-through-nature-based-solutions-and-empowerment-tools/). According to [EKLIPSE's final report](https://eklipse.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Eklipse-EmpowerUs-Report-1-24-Building-RCC_final2.pdf), the majority of studies addressed NbS and ET together, indicating that the integration of participatory approaches and ET at various stages and levels within NbS projects can effectively foster empowerment, and as a consequence, social ecological resilience. Coastal environments held the dominant presence in NbS studies, while the prevailing NbS approaches included Ecosystem-based Adaptation and Ecosystem-based Management. Most of these case studies favoured a top-down governance process, focussing on informing or consulting communities rather than actively involving or empowering them.

9. ['Remarkable' progress made towards incorporating Traditional Knowledge into the biodiversity plan](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/remarkable-progress-made-towards-incorporating-traditional-knowledge-into-the-biodiversity-plan). Countries must respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities to achieve the world's major international commitment on biodiversity. This includes acknowledging Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' rights to nature and their contributions to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Monitoring how their rights are realised is crucial. Traditional knowledge indicators are a key tool to embed Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' actions in the implementation and the monitoring processes of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The four key traditional knowledge indicators that relate to Indigenous Peoples' collective rights are: trends in linguistic diversity and numbers of speakers of Indigenous languages; trends in land-use change and land tenure in the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; trends in the practice of traditional occupations; and trends in the degree to which traditional knowledge and practices are respected. 

**Climate**
1. ELATIA, the Indigenous Peoples' Global Partnership on Climate Change, Forests and Sustainable Development, has been selected to [conduct a comprehensive Global Data Study on Indigenous Peoples' Climate Contributions](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/elatia-winner-of-global-indigenous-climate-finance-study-bid/). This study aims to bolster long-term access to climate finance for Indigenous Peoples by meticulously documenting their efforts in climate action across the seven socio-cultural regions.

2. [London faces significant flood risks due to rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storms driven by climate change](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-plan-to-protect-london-from-the-growing-flood-threat/). The Thames Barrier, crucial for the city's protection, was originally designed for a 1-in-1,000 year storm surge. However, with the current pace of climate change-induced sea-level rise, this protection level is diminishing, leaving the city more vulnerable. TEAM2100 has been launched to improve London's flood defences, which involve regular inspections, upgrades and refurbishments, and asset management. 

3. The CEO of the Nature Conservancy, Jennifer Morris, addresses the [urgent need for more innovative climate adaptation strategies](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/the-nature-conservancy-ceo-jennifer-morris-we-are-in-the-age-of-adaptation/), emphasising transforming stakeholder engagement and enhancing financial support mechanisms, advocating for governance by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Up until this point, climate adaptation finance has been largely theoretical and nowhere near the scale needed. It is not uncommon to secure a two-year funding commitment for a project that needs seven to ten years of partnership to see real change. 

4. [Canada's Record-breaking 2023 wildfires released nearly 4 times more carbon than global aviation](https://www.wri.org/insights/canada-wildfire-emissions), caused billions of dollars in property damage and displaced thousands of people from their homes. Roughly 7.8 million hectares of forests were burned, more than 6 times the annual average since 2001. This amount of tree cover loss produced roughly 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide, nearly 4 times the carbon emissions of the global aviation sector in 2022, and 25% more than from all tropical primary forest loss combined in 2023.

**Oceans**
1. Challenger 150, which coordinates a global effort to map life in the deep sea, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project, an initiative dedicated to inspiring and coordinating the global effort to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade. [Consolidating the physical and biological ocean data being identified and produced by the two separate initiatives will greatly advance our understanding of the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/major-boost-for-oceanic-research-as-challenger-150-joins-forces-with-seabed-2030/). The [latest percentage of ocean floor mapped, 26.1%](https://oceandecade.org/news/seabed-2030-announces-latest-progress-on-world-hydrography-day/), marked an increase of 4.34 million square kilometres of new data, which is the equivalent to an area the size of the European Union, and led to discoveries such as the largest known deep sea coral reef habitat, spanning over 6.4 million acres on the Blake Plateau, off the southeast coast of the USA. [Four underwater mountains were discovered](https://schmidtocean.org/four-new-seamounts-discovered-in-the-high-seas/) using multibeam mapping techniques. And [over 100 potential new marine species have been identified](https://schmidtocean.org/underwater-mountains-harbor-abundant-life/) during a single deep sea expedition.

2. Great Barrier Reef Traditional Owners are sharing their world-leading approach to weaving Traditional Knowledge with Western science, in a bid to help protect coral reefs as the world grapples with the 4th global mass coral bleaching event. A new campaign, ['The World is Watching'](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-world-is-watching-as-traditional-owners-lead-the-way-in-reef-protection/), was launched at the UN Ocean Decade Conference in Barcelona, to elevate Traditional Owners' voices and showcase how their world-first co-design and co=delivery model for conservation is setting a new global standard for Indigenous-led solutions. 

3. BULA Reef off Plantation Island Resort's coast in Malolo District, Fiji, is now [the largest rescue reef of its kind in history](https://oceandecade.org/news/launching-fijis-bula-reef/), written in over a thousand heat-adapted 'super corals', taken from areas of extreme heat stress where corals were in danger of dying due to an approaching marine heat wave. The word 'BULA' is a Fijian greeting, and means 'life'. The BULA Reef is the world's biggest word ever written underwater, at 16 x 45 metre. 

4. The [first-ever SeaVoice book](https://oceandecade.org/news/seavoice-launches-first-book-uplifting-coastal-voices-in-un-endorsed-initiative/), backed by the United Nations Ocean Decade, has launched, and features a curated selection of 20 stories from 16 countries that highlight the voices of ocean advocates, scientists, artists and community members working and living around the ocean. Only 500 copies are being printed, and [the books can be ordered](https://www.seavoice.online/theannual) for free, with readers paying for postage and packaging.

5. The [Ocean Census Arctic Deep Expedition has documented extraordinary biodiversity](https://oceandecade.org/news/unveiling-life-in-the-arctic-abyss-ocean-census-expedition-reveals-biodiversity-wonders-at-lifes-extremes/), such as shrimps covered in hair-like bacteria feasting on methane, stalked jellyfish resembling underwater flowers, armoured crustaceans, forests of tube worms, fish with antifreeze proteins in their blood and animals living with bacteria that can turn toxic chemicals into energy, living thousands of metres below the Arctic surface in a region now threatened by ocean warming and deep seabed mining. 

6. Global Fishing Watch and the Gulf of Guinea Regional Fisheries Commission launched a [new strategic partnership to address urgent maritime challenges in the Gulf of Guinea](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-and-gulf-of-guinea-regional-fisheries-commission-forge-partnership-in-fight-against-illegal-fishing/), including that of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The Gulf has long been subject to IUU fishing, with damages estimated at an annual economic loss of over 2 billion USD. 

7. [Recent statistics on marine biodiversity conservation have been published in the IOC State of the Ocean Report 2024](https://www.obis.org/2024/06/03/stor-2024/), reveal interesting statistics on how much we know about which species, especially those threatened with extinction, occur in Marine Protected Areas. As of now, 93,106 marine species have been documented within these designated areas, marking a significant milestone in the effort to preserve marine life. These records, compiled from nearly 50 million distribution data points, highlight that half of these data were collected in the past eight years, indicating a growing focus on these protected regions. It was found that over half of all, and 72% of threatened, species have been reported in Marine Protected Areas occupying 9% of the world's ocean. For the majority of the threatened species, only a small fraction (median 7%) of their habitat falls within Marine Protected Areas.

8. The UN Ocean Decade [White Paper on Challenge 7](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390124.locale=en), 'Expand the Global Ocean Observing System', [strongly advocates for a transformative era for ocean observing](https://goosocean.org/news/un-ocean-decade-challenge-7-white-paper-a-roadmap-for-the-observing-system-we-need/), setting the path for a robust, responsive, and sustainable observing system. The white paper highlights significant gaps in the current ocean observing system, including insufficient observational coverage, especially in deep ocean and polar regions, and the need for improved data integration and sharing. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. From monitoring climate change to preserving biodiversity, [AI-driven technologies empower researchers to gather and analyse data with heightened levels of precision and efficiency](https://earthobservations.org/news/harnessing-ai-earth-observations-all). GEO Work Programmes have started using AI: in a survey conducted in early 2024, around half of GEO Work Programme activities identified themselves as advanced or medium in the level of AI applications, where AI is often used for image classification, change detection and predictive modelling. For example, a GEO initiative providing flood forecasts globally with 15-days lead time based on historical data and near-term observations is using a trained global model with available local in-situ measures to capture similarities in hydrological behaviours so that river runoff and discharge forecasts can be made for areas without gauges.

2. A [comprehensive remote sensing forecast for wheat pests and diseases across Asia, Europe and North America](https://earthobservations.org/news/geo-project-forecasts-global-wheat-pest-and-disease-implications) has shown that the main types of wheat pests are rust and aphids, which can both lead to significant yield loss. The forecasted total area affected by these issues is about 24,8 million hectares.

**News and updates about applications**
1. Forest monitoring in communal territories has been going on for many years and has been embraced strongly, becoming a core part of the culture of Indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Despite threats, these communities were able to decrease deforestation in their areas by more than 50% in just a year when using satellite data from Global Forest Watch in their monitoring. Now, [Indigenous leaders in Peru are working collaboratively to develop new resources using MapBuilder](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/indigenous-communities-peru-amazon-mapbuilder/), a tool that is helping them to control the data and narrative around deforestation in their territories and the threats they face to better work together, target solutions, and guard and defend their territories against latent threats to ancestral forests. 

2. [MapTiler Engine 13.3 has been released](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/06/merging-tilesets-in-maptiler-engine-13-3/). The key benefits are the possibility to merge multiple tilesets into a single file, which makes updating large tilesets with new data more efficient, improved performance for all input data formats, both raster and vector data, and MapTiler Engine can now be tried for free for 2 weeks, without the need for credit card details.

**Indices and indicators**
1. The Copernicus Marine Service announced the [Mean Sea Level anomalies indicator for Europe](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/june-2024-release). The change in Mean Sea Level is a key indicator of our evolving climate. It reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Due to its importance for understanding the state of the ocean and impacts of global warming, Copernicus Marine is launching this new [Ocean Monitoring Indicator](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-monitoring-indicators).

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [new OBIS Data Policy for data sharing and use](https://www.obis.org/2024/06/19/data-policy-stors/) in OBIS is [available](https://manual.obis.org/policy.html). The policy aligns with the new UNESCO IOC Data Policy and Terms of Use, and emphasises the importance of adhering to the FAIR and CARE Principles, data quality, accessibility and transparency. It outlines specific requirements for data submission, including metadata standards, quality control procedures, and protocols for data updates and corrections, and addresses issues including data ownership, citation, and intellectual property rights.

2. [DataCite launched a pilot to help track awards and related outputs](https://datacite.org/blog/guidance-for-registering-datacite-dois-for-awards/). Traditionally, research funding organisations create and manage grant and award-related information internally and track the impact of their investments through elaborate reporting procedures. These processes can be improved by leveraging DOIs and metadata. 

3. [Data Stewardship Wizard and FAIRsharing collaborate to share policy, database and standard metadata](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=824). Data management plans (DMPs) play the crucial role of outlining researchers' intentions in following best practices to ensure datasets, code and other digital objects are FAIR. To develop effective DMPs, authors of those DMPs must be able to unambiguously and explicitly identify and name the community standards (e.g. terminologies, models, formats, minimal information requirements), and databases (repositories, knowledge bases) appropriate for describing and sharing their type of digital object (e.g., datasets, software, survey) within their discipline(s), as well as know the requirements of their funder's policy. FAIRsharing provides not only manually-curated records for standards, databases and policies, but also a [rich graph of the connectivity among these resources](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=806), placing each record within the broader context of the research data landscape. Key features of this new collaborative phase include identifiability (FAIRsharing DOIs which will be extended to policies), connectivity (making relationships among standards, databases and policies accessible to DSW users), and machine actionability (further enhancing the creation of machine-actionable DMPs through the use of FAIRsharing DOIs within DMPs and the ability to pull appropriate resource metadata from FAIRsharing records following the principles of Linked Open Data).

1. The [online learning tool](https://www.ipbes.net/ias/learning) featuring interactive graphical elements, animations and case studies from the IPBES Invasive Alien Species Report was launched. 

2. [Degradation of nature could reduce UK GDP by 12% as early as 2030](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/degradation-of-nature-could-reduce-uk-gdp-by-12-per-cent). Researchers at UNEP-WCMC have contributed to the [first analysis to quantify the impact of nature degradation on a country's economy](https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GFI-UK-NATURE-RELATED-RISKS-FULL-REPORT.pdf), which included soil health decline, global food security repercussions, zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The estimated loss is larger than that resulting from the global financial crisis and Covid-19 pandemic, and nature-related risks are as detrimental or more to the economy as those from climate risks. However, while the economic costs of climate change are becoming increasingly accepted, the risks posed by nature degradation amount to a material cost that has not been sufficiently factored into financial and business decision-making. 

3. The [largest modelling study of its kind to date shows an urgent need for policies that better understand the interlinked nature of climate change and biodiversity loss](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/largest-modelling-study-of-its-kind-highlights-need-for-joined-up-climate-and-biodiversity-policy) and their potential impacts on human societies. Global biodiversity declined by between 2 and 11% during the 20th century due to land-use change alone, according to the [large multi-model study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn3441) which was published in Science last month. Projections show that climate change could become the main driver of biodiversity decline by the mid-21st century.

4. Researchers from UNEP-WCMC have [conducted](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/researchers-call-for-consistent-monitoring-of-commitments-to-nature-as-analysis-reveals-national-reporting-shortfalls) the [first high-level analysis of countries' policy pledges for nature and subsequent reporting of actions taken under the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi biodiversity targets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44185-024-00039-5.epdf). They discovered that 44% of traceable commitments from national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) could not be linked to evidence of actions taken in their follow-up progress reports. At the end of the Decade on Biodiversity, it became clear that there were major shortfalls and the world had largely failed to achieve the global targets. To ensure accountable action for nature, policymakers need to know where, how and why previous commitments did not succeed. National reports do not always follow the same format as the NBSAPs, making simple summaries of progress challenging. To overcome this, the research team cross-referenced the NBSAPs against those countries' sixth national reports. After sorting and classifying commitments according to the Aichi Targets that they would contribute to, they found 7,931 traceable commitments, 56% of which were identifiable in a national report. Three-quarters of those traceable pledges were listed as having some level of success, however, 44% of previous global commitments were apparently not being tracked.  

5. [Launch of the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024: New data, trends, threats and possible solutions to combat illegal wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/launch-of-world-wildlife-crime-report-2024). The [report](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/wildlife.html) presents a systematic analysis of wildlife crime harms and impacts, probes the factors driving wildlife trafficking trends, and takes stock of current knowledge about the effectiveness of the different types of interventions being pursued to resolve wildlife crime. 

6. [Global report on food crises is a wake-up call](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/global-report-on-food-crises-is-a-wake-up-call/en). The [report](https://www.fsinplatform.org/global-report-food-crises-2024) shows that food crises are becoming increasingly protracted and underscored the risk that 'hard-won development gains are being reversed'. The report found that 282 million people in 59 countries and territories needed urgent action to reduce the food consumption gap, and 36 million people are in the IPC Phase 4, which is defined as Emergency, and require urgent action. 36 Countries have featured in this report for the past 8 years, highlighting the difficulty of restoring food security once its absence becomes acute.

7. [Are rare species more common than common species and is there a universal shape to the distribution of species abundance?](https://www.gbif.org/data-use/eicNfKNgbTHiIveqMpjA1/are-rare-species-more-common-than-common-species) To explore these questions, researchers downloaded all GBIF-mediated species occurrence data from 1880 to 2020, and [analysed global species abundance distributions for 39 classes of eukaryotes and prepared visualisations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02173-y) that show the number of species within abundance categories, ranging from single individuals to millions of individuals. Improved sampling and greater availability of data over time unveiled that by 2000, the distribution of bird species abundances was nearly perfectly bell-shaped and symmetrical, with most species having intermediate abundances. Among other taxa, such as amphibians and ray-finned fishes, the distributions were not fully uncovered, but exhibited similar patterns of unveiling over time, moving towards a bell-shaped, unimodal distribution.

8. [Populations of migratory freshwater fish species, including salmon, trout, eel and sturgeon, continue to decline](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/staggering-collapse-in-migratory-fish-populations-threatens-health-of-millions-and-critical-freshwater-ecosystems), risking the food security and livelihoods of millions of people, the survival of countless other species and the health and resilience of rivers, lakes and wetlands. The new [Living Planet Index report](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/2024-living-planet-index-update-for-migratory-freshwater-fishes) on freshwater migratory fishes reveals a staggering 81% collapse in monitored population sizes on average between 1970 to 2020, including catastrophic declines of 91% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 75% in Europe.

9. FAO [launched](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-action-plan-launched-for-implementing-fao-strategy-mainstreaming-biodiversity-across-agricultural-sectors-as-biodiversityrelated-projects-approved/en) its [2024-27 Action Plan](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd0709en) for the implementation of the FAO Strategy on Mainstreaming Biodiversity Across Agricultural Sectors, with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biodiversity, to promote sustainable agricultural practices and to conserve, enhance, preserve and restore biodiversity as a whole. The action plan sets out a wide range of deliverables including support for countries in the implementation and monitoring of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

10. A [new report outlines the progress of the first eight countries participating in the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network Initiative](https://www.besnet.world/navigating-towards-a-nature-positive-future/), Cameroon, Colombia, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Viet Nam, a collaborative initiative aimed at translating insights from global, regional and national biodiversity assessments into actionable measures for sustainable ecosystem management. By enhancing their science-policy synergies, these countries have made significant strides in policy alignment, governance strengthening, multi-stakeholder collaboration, ecosystem restoration, sustainable resource management and community livelihood enhancement.

**Climate**
1. Race to Resilience in action: [Replacing degraded land in Suriname with sustainable coconut farms](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-in-action-replacing-degraded-land-in-suriname-with-sustainable-coconut-farms/?_gl=1*r7w7kk*_ga*NDA5MTg0NDcyLjE3MDk1NjU5MTU.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTcxNjk5MDAyMy4yLjEuMTcxNjk5MDE3NC4wLjAuMA..) by planting a coconut tree seeling nursery and planting hardwood trees across a sprawling 1,200-hectare farm leased from the Surinamese government.

2. [Revitalised landscapes damaged by intense agriculture in Brazil's Paraná State](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/revitalizing-landscapes-damaged-by-intensive-agriculture-in-brazils-parana-state/). This project will restore 1,400 hectares of degraded land, impacting the local ecosystem positively and providing about 300 jobs in the area, enhancing living conditions and boosting local economies. 

3. Forests play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. To manage and protect forests, information on where forests are gaining or losing carbon are needed. Global Forest Watch [released](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/whats-new-carbon-flux-monitoring/) maps and associated statistics of forest greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration (forest carbon removals) and net greenhouse gas flux in 2021 based on a geospatial framework designed to be improved over time as relevant new data and information are produced. 


**Oceans**
1. OBIS and GBIF have [agreed](https://www.obis.org/2024/04/28/obis-gbif-partnership-ren/) to a [joint strategy](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-kcqs-5h52) and [action plan](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-e52v-5875) to deepen their collaboration, improve the flows and services of high-quality data about marine and coastal biodiversity and support research and decision-making on the world's oceans. More information about the strategy and action plan and involvement will be shared during 2 joint webinars on the 13th of June 2024: [07:00 UTC for Asia, Africa and Europe](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_MGK5uCxcRG2dyHoOeul8iQ) and [21:00 UTC for the Americas](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_JAyHic4xS1yx-TKYHsfVMg).

2. [Inspiring collaborative ocean action on a global scale: Ocean Decade launches new online training course on co-design](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-launches-new-online-course-on-co-design/). The course aims to equip participants with a fundamental understanding and knowledge of co-design methodologies for the implementation of current Decade Actions and development of Decade Action proposals. The training will build ocean stakeholders' practical skills for effective leadership in co-design processes and contribute to collaborative ocean research and policymaking. The 18-hour course is self-paced and free for everyone to [join](https://bit.ly/codesign-oceandecade). 

3. Coral reefs support a wide range of marine life, providing habitat, shelter and breeding grounds for many species of fish, invertebrates, and plants. Coral reefs are natural barriers that protect coastlines from erosion and storms and are vital to the economies of many coastal communities. They often support commercial fisheries, tourism, and shoreline protection activities. Additionally, they play a role in the global carbon cycle: coral polyps extract calcium carbonate from seawater to build their skeletons, which in turn removes carbon dioxide from the water. Pollution, overfishing and coastal development are some of the major threats to coral reefs, which in turn destabilise marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Rising sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching and eventual coral mortality, and ocean acidification and deoxygenation also damage coral reefs. [Copernicus Marine and Coral Guardian have joined forces to conserve coral reefs and promote marine sustainability](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-and-coral-guardian-partner-conserve-coral-reefs). Additionally, the [Coral Reef Breakthrough](https://racetozero.unfccc.int/system/coral-reef-breakthrough/) was [established](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-global-coalition-forging-coral-reef-resilience/) to provide targets and action points for collective action, including stopping drivers of loss, doubling the area of coral reefs under effective protection, accelerating restoration efforts and securing $12 billion USD from public and private sources by 2030 to conserve and restore at least 50% of remaining coral reef ecosystems.

4. [NCEAS' Arctic Data Center and partners tackle much-needed observation of permafrost thaw across the global Arctic region](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/sinking-soil-rising-research). Permafrost, earth that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, is the foundation of much of the global Arctic region. Thaw of ice-rich permafrost causes the ground to subside, slump, or crack. Permafrost thaw is an ecological and societal problem so complex that no single institution or government can address it alone. In 2019, the Arctic Data Center (ADC) and several other institutions analysed data from 175,000 satellite images to create the first snapshot of permafrost across the entire Arctic. Now, with a recently received $5 million grant, the team seeks to track thaw in near real-time by analysing other available data multiple times a year. 

5. [Call for new members of the Global Observing Oceanographic System Biology and Ecosystems Expert Panel](https://goosocean.org/news/call-for-new-members-of-the-goos-biology-and-ecosystems-expert-panel/) with an expertise in zooplankton ecology, hard coral reefs, continental shelf benthic invertebrate  ecology, macroalgal ecology, sea turtle ecology, seagrass observations and assessments, marine mammal ecology, ocean sound in relation to quantifying anthropogenic sound and pressures on marine fauna, and marine microbial ecology. Members will be expected to voluntarily commit roughly 12 days per year, including meeting with the Panel four times a year (mostly virtually). The deadline is the 14th of July 2024, close of business UTC. Any inquiries or to submit your application can be send to ([goosbioeco\@gmail.com](mailto:goosbioeco@gmail.com))

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Space for Climate Observatory adds 33 tools and resources to GEO Knowledge Hub](https://earthobservations.org/news/space-climate-observatory-adds-33-tools-and-resources-geo-knowledge-hub), with more to come. The resources are available in the [SCO Community](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/communities/space-climate-observatory?q=&f=resource_type%3Aknowledge&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest), and will be essential for anyone working on climate monitoring, mitigation, and adaptation. 

2. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) team up to [enhance the use of AI in marine research](https://oceandecade.org/news/mbari-and-worms-collaborating-to-build-open-datasets-of-ocean-life-with-fathomnet/). Before AI can be used to analyse ocean visual data, it must be trained to accurately identify marine life. FathomNet, a global, open-source image and machine learning model repository, contains over 100,000 labelled images and shares machine learning models that can be used to identify ocean animals. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [OpenMapTiles 3.15 has been released](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/04/openstreetmap-data-prepared-for-advanced-cartography/). With the latest update, Aboriginal lands have been introduced in OpenMapTiles to promote awareness and recognition of Indigenous communities. Highway networks are now visible as early as zoom level 4, significantly improving the map's comprehensiveness and accuracy. Pond has been introduced as a new class for minor water bodies, making it possible to style big lakes differently. Additionally, long-distance ferry routes have been added. Aboriginal lands have been introduced in OpenMapTiles to promote awareness and recognition of Indigenous communities. 

2. Global Earth Observation for Water Sustainability [released](https://earthobservations.org/news/advanced-streamflow-data-now-available-publicly-cloud-opening-new-era-water-management) its [Version 2.0 Streamflow Forecast Data](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-aboaljwcz64zs#overview), with improved accessibility and enhanced features to better support water resource management. Data is free to download, and no registration is necessary, and users can bulk download extended historical and forecast data.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The Global Ocean Observing System has [released](https://goosocean.org/news/global-ocean-observing-systems-cross-network-data-implementation-strategy-released/) its Cross-Network [Data Implementation Strategy](https://goosocean.org/document/33970) to ensure that all their ocean data and metadata is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The [annual tree cover loss data for 2023](https://research.wri.org/gfr/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends) has been released. Brazil and Colombia experienced a remarkable 36% and 49% decrease in primary forest loss, respectively. However, the rate of tropical primary forest loss in 2023 remained consistent with recent years, with sharp increases in Bolivia, Laos, and Nicaragua. The total tropical primary forest loss totaled 3.7 million hectares, the equivalent of almost 10 football fields per minute. 

2. All over the world, efforts are ongoing to [protect, sustainably manage and restore areas of forest](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/forest-restoration-in-action-celebrating-pledges-to-inspire-society). Countries have promised to restore 1 billion hectares of land by 2030 as part of international climate, nature and land goals. Some of these initiatives are famous, covering tens of thousands of hectares and winning awards, such as the Desa'a Forest project in Ethiopia, part of the Great Green Wall programme to restore ecosystems across northern Africa. But most, particularly those carried out by non-state organisations and individuals, do not receive the same fanfare and often take place without formal recognition and acknowledgement. The UN Environment Programme World Conservation and Monitoring Centre works to make sure the contributions of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, private landowners, non-government organisations, and local administrations such as cities and businesses are recorded and celebrated on its [Nature Commitments platform](https://naturecommitments.org/). The website showcases more than 200 area-based conservation pledges, several of which are forest restoration initiatives.

3. A [survey on the value of ecosystem services provided by vultures in Southern Africa](https://survey.alchemer.eu/s3/90666696/Vulture-Valuation-International-Survey) has been developed by BirdLife International. The survey takes 5 - 10 minutes and has the purpose to understand the value that people place on vulture conservation. 

4. [Robust Indigenous and local land rights are vital](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/returning-to-the-wisdom-of-our-ancestors/) for managing forests, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving biodiversity and improving livelihoods. Climate Champions held [an interview](https://youtu.be/u6J-M2ttY1Q) with the executive director of Tenure Facility. As part of her work, Nonette Royo has helped to map and protect millions of hectares of land, and offers grants and technical assistance directly to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. A [recent report](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/11/indigenous-people-get-less-than-1-of-climate-funding-its-actually-worse-commentary/) showed that 0.13% of climate funding has actually been reaching Indigenous Peoples and Local communities for tenure and forest management. However, research over the last 5 years shows that deforestation rates are three to four times lower in territories with secure tenure, showing that ownership is key to conserving what we have and restoring what we have lost.

**Climate**
1. Women, gender-diverse individuals and marginalised communities often bear the brunt of the impact of climate change, while they have the least resources to adapt and are often responsible for securing food and water for their families. [Scale for Resilience seeks to empower women to become agents of change in building climate resilience within their communities](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/revolutionizing-resilience-through-womens-impact-in-climate-smart-finance/). The initiative, Female leadership for the transition towards regenerative economies, is a part of the overarching goal to make 3 million vulnerable populations more resilient by 2030 by facilitating access to finance for increased resilience along the financial value chain. 

2. Freshwater, the livelihood of ecosystems and societies, is under threat from the increasing impacts of climate change, one of which is salinisation. The increasing salinity of water and soil not only poses a challenge to agricultural productivity but also to the communities that live and work on the land. For Egypt's Nile Delta, a critical area for the country's agriculture and home to a quarter of its population, the impacts of climate change pose significant risks to farming, livelihoods and the national economy. As sea levels rise, low-lying areas, especially those in the Nile Delta region, are at risk of flooding, preventing the natural flushing of salts from the soil, leading to build up over time. An [initiative to maintain healthy and abundant yields and adapt to soil and water salinity is underway](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/salt-resistant-crops-and-the-race-to-secure-the-resilience-of-smallholder-farmers-in-egypts-nile-delta/) to help build salt-resilient crops, such as wheat, bare barley, common barley, corn, millet and maize, and through the restoration of degraded agricultural land. 

3. [Key climate action themes for 2024](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/where-are-we-and-where-are-we-going-next-key-climate-action-themes-for-2024/). In the COP28 outcome governments explicitly stated that we must transition away from fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner. It also underscored the importance of the global goal on adaptation in strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, as well as the vital importance of protecting and restoring nature, by 2030. According to Climate Analytics, an estimated 8 trillion USD investment is needed to deliver on the COP28 pledge to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030, compared to an expected 6 trillion USD in fossil fuels investments this decade. With the next generation of NDCs due by the first quarter of 2025, 2024 is a crucial year to act on the Global Stocktake outcome in COP28 and ensure that all sectors of the economy and all levels of society have a stake in enhancing national climate implementation plans.

4. Over one billion people worldwide currently live in self-built homes in informal urban settlements, outside of regulatory frameworks and without formal land tenure. These settlements often lack basic infrastructure such as sanitation, clean water and electricity, with residents also often facing the constant threat of eviction. The [Roof over our heads campaign](https://campaignforrooh.org/) is designed to [help women leaders from informal settlements to advance resilient, low carbon and affordable homes and solutions for their urban communities](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/from-invisible-and-informal-to-recognised-and-resilient-sheela-patel/) thereby advancing the overall climate resilience of their cities. 

5. [Johannesburg is currently confronting an unprecedented water crisis](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/inspiring-a-whole-of-society-mindset-shift-on-water), affecting those living in informal settlements as well as those in more affluent suburbs. In recent weeks, thousands of people in South Africa's largest city and economic hub have had to line up to collect water delivered by municipal tanker trucks, with taps running dry as a heatwave and crumbling infrastructure deplete the city's reservoirs. Among the climate impacts South Africa will likely face a decrease in rainfall. Water stress is a priority problem across the country, caused by excessive use, growing demand, pollution, inadequate infrastructure, poor practices and unequal access to water. Adding to these problems is climate change. Without a fundamental shift in the way South Africa thinks about water and a massive USD 60 billion investment, the country [will run out of water by 2030](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/partner-content-south-africa-danger-of-running-out-of-water).

6. The recently published [2024 temperature change statistics update](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1679824/) covers the period 1961 - 2023 for 198 countries and 39 territories. It provides country-level information on observed temperature change trends on land, as a basis to help identify risk and design the responses necessary to safeguard the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. The Paris Agreement limit of  1.5°C was surpassed in all regions in 2023, except in Oceania (0.9°C), with the largest temperature increase recorded in Europe (2.4°C), and the last 9 years were the nine warmest years on record.  

**Oceans**
1. [5.7 million euro BioEcoOcean Project will contribute to GOOS Essential Ocean Variables](https://goosocean.org/news/5-7-million-euro-bioecoocean-project-will-contribute-to-goos-essential-ocean-variables/). A new EU-funded project will provide a step change in how we observe the ocean to improve biodiversity and climate assessments. With a focus on fostering collaboration, advancing technology, and adhering to FAIR data principles, BioEcoOcean aims to bring about a systemic change in the way we understand and monitor the ocean. A key outcome of the project will be a Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science.

2. [UNEP-WCMC marine experts progress working definition of 'destructive fishing' to enable more sustainable and equitable practices](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-marine-experts-progress-working-definition-of-destructive-fishing-to-enable-more-sustainable-and-equitable-practices). Many policies and international frameworks recognise the need to end destructive fishing practices to conserve marine resources, protect the ocean and ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet. However, despite its widespread use, 'destructive fishing' is currently undefined and therefore immeasurable. The working definition, which will meaningfully support countries to monitor and reduce destructive fishing practices, is: 'destructive fishing is any fishing practice that causes irrecoverable habitat degradation, or which causes significant adverse environmental impacts, results in long-term declines in target or non-target species beyond biologically safe limits and has negative livelihood impacts'. Now that a starting definition has been proposed, the ambition of the project team is to work with stakeholders to further develop a consensus-built definition of 'destructive fishing' and encourage its adoption.

3. Pioneering [open access to unprecedented amounts of ecology data from an offshore wind farm](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/pioneering-open-access-to-unprecedented-amounts-of-ecology-data-from-offshore-wind-farm), which aims to be the most ecological wind farm, on the Dutch coast, to date with numerous ecological innovations. The winning bid focuses on innovative ecology measures and has a strong emphasis on data sharing and transparency. Through sharing data on the Ocean Data Platform, Ecowende, is contributing to a deeper understanding of the complexities inherent in our oceans - which is important as the North Sea is overexploited and largely unmapped. The data provided will come from numerous sensors in its offshore installations and stand-alone surveys. These sensors monitor a variety of species and other oceanic parameters, both above and below the water, such as bird observations, bat presence, underwater telemetry and acoustic data.

4. ['Making Oceans Count II' Initiative to expand ocean asset metrics and data for a sustainable blue economy](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/making-oceans-count-nbspinitiative-to-expand-ocean-asset-metrics-and-data-for-a-sustainable-blue-economy). The Making Oceans Count II will develop much-needed indicators and metrics for measuring impacts and dependencies from human activities on nature. Ocean assets metrics are parameters or measurements used to assess the health, productivity, and sustainability of ocean resources. With a primary focus on Denmark and the Nordics, the program is poised to generate insights with global relevance for a well-supported, sustainable blue economy, but initially focussing on further enhancing metrics related to the shipping industry, then broadening its scope to include offshore renewable energy as another critical sector.

5. An average of 85% of people polled worldwide believe a [soon-to-be concluded global plastic pollution treaty should ban single-use plastics](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/85-of-people-want-global-ban-on-single-use-plastics) that now account for more than 70% of ocean plastic pollution, according to a survey of more than 24,000 people in 32 countries commissioned by WWF and the Plastic Free Foundation. Other highly favoured bans include those on harmful chemicals used in plastic (which 90% supported) and plastic products that cannot be easily and safely recycled in the countries where they are used (87%). 

6. [Call for tender: Coastal and Arctic Hub Uptake](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/call-tender-coastal-arctic-hub-uptake), with a focus on improving their usability to attract new users. Applicants are invited to develop downstream applications or services that are linked to the Coastal or Arctic Hub and aligned with their specific themes (e.g. climate change); use products from Copernicus Marine Service and at least one other Copernicus Service; and emphasise the integration and adaptation of Copernicus products. Six products will be selected and each project will receive €100,000 in funding. The call is open until 26 April 2024. 

7. The [EU Copernicus Ocean State Report has been recognised as an action under the Mission 'Restore our Ocean and Waters' charter](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/ocean-state-report-recognised-under-eu-mission-restore-our-ocean-and-waters-charter). This recognition underscores the importance of the Copernicus Marine Service in achieving the objectives of the Mission Ocean and Waters initiative. It also highlights the importance of the [Ocean State Report](https://sp.copernicus.org/articles/1-osr7/index.html) as a valuable document for scientists, members of the blue economy, decision makers, and the public, providing a comprehensive overview on the state of the ocean. 

8. Global Fishing Watch has announced [three pioneering collaborations](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/our-ocean-conference-global-fishing-watch-international-partnerships-enhance-ocean-management/) with Greece, Panama and the West African Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission in a bid to harness technology and data-driven solutions for enhanced transparency, improved fisheries management and greater ocean sustainability. The partnership will leverage open data to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, promote sustainable fisheries management and enable marine protection through deepened engagement with governmental bodies spanning three continents. In addition, they will provide Global Fishing Watch the opportunity to highlight transparency as a critical marine management tool and advance policy reforms regarding the adoption of vessel tracking methods like automatic identification systems and vessel monitoring systems, as well as regional data sharing practices.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. On the 23rd March WWF's Earth Hour was held. This year, [WWF encourages individuals to 'Give an hour for earth'](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/earth-hour-2024-give-an-hour-for-earth) by spending 60 minutes participating in any eco-positive activity from now until Earth Day on the 22nd of April. There is an [online interactive tool](http://wwf.earth/hour) that suggests activities for various lifestyles and interests, and participants can log their contribution to the national and global 'Hour Bank'.

2. [Out of the woodlands: innovating satellite data use in Asia-Pacific biodiversity conservation](https://www.planet.com/pulse/out-of-the-woodlands-innovating-satellite-data-use-in-asia-pacific-biodiversity-conservation/). The International Day of Forests is observed for people to work together to ensure forests are part of any future climate change strategies. This year, Asia-Pacific's lush forests and deep dive into satellite data's role in preserving these natural carbon sinks were highlighted to raise awareness. Satellite data has emerged as a game-changer in the field of forestry management and conservation. Data was used for internal monitoring and categorising them into rehabilitation, conservation, or protection status. The images served as an external communications medium to communities benefiting from the project. 

3. A [digital milestone in wildlife conservation, CITES-LEX](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-lex-launched-2024), has been launched. [CITES-LEX](https://citeslex.fao.org/) is designed to assist Parties to the CITES of Wild Fauna and Flora to navigate the complexities of international trade in species listed in the CITES Appendices by providing comprehensive access to national catalogues and legislative policies. This multilateral agreement aims to ensure that international trade does not threaten the survival of these species.

4. Wildland fires threaten communities and landscapes as climate change continues to drive increased heat and drought intensity. [Recent studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.825190/full) have confirmed that forest fires today burn roughly twice as much tree cover as they did two decades ago, with monumental costs in damage to infrastructure, property, natural resources and response operations. The moisture contained in living vegetation, live fuel moisture, is a strong indicator of wildfire risk. In many wildfire-prone areas, government employees regularly collect vegetation samples from specific locations to understand how quickly fuels will burn. However, field studies can be difficult to regularly perform at the landscape scale, especially in remote regions. Studies show that soil water content is a leading indicator of live fuel moisture; when soils are drier than normal, vegetation is more likely to burn. With novel remote sensing techniques, vegetation dryness and wildfire risk can be measured over large areas at a higher frequency than before. [Planet Soil Water Content](https://content.planet.com/c/planet-datasheet-soi-2?x=AmSTOq&_gl=1*1kqbd0p*_gcl_au*MTY4Njk5MzM5Ni4xNzEwMTczMTQy) data, derived from satellite sensors, is strongly correlated with ground measurements of soil moisture, and can be used as an input in wildfire risk models. There are two on-demand webinars developed by Planet: [Natural disaster management: monitoring wildfire risk and hazard fuels removal](https://learn.planet.com/Monitoring-Wildfire-Risk-and-Hazard-Fuels-Removal-Register.html?_gl=1*1tz9mgh*_gcl_au*MTYyNDI0ODYyMC4xNzEzMjcwMjQz) and [Planet data for multi-hazard risk mitigation in U.S. State and local government](https://learn.planet.com/Multi-Hazard-Risk-Mitigation-Registration.html?_gl=1*1tz9mgh*_gcl_au*MTYyNDI0ODYyMC4xNzEzMjcwMjQz).

5. An ocean matchmaking tool, called the '[Ocean Matcher](https://www.oceanmatcher.com/)', aims to tackle the funding challenge of the Ocean Decade, and to facilitate [smart matching between scientists and innovators on the one hand and philanthropists and investors on the other](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/the-funding-we-need-for-the-ocean-we-want-introducing-the-ocean-matcher). Leveraging algorithmic matching technology and a natural language model, Ocean Matcher will be a paradigm shift in the allocation of funding for the ocean, steering towards a healthier planet. So far, the feasibility study and Proof of Concept have produced positive results. The initiators and the project team aim to drive the development from the Proof of Concept to a live pilot, heading towards full scale launch when reaching organic product-market fit. 

6. [Planet Insights Platform delivers powerful tooling for unlocking earth observation data](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-insights-platform/). [Planet Insights Platform](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-insights-platform/) is the next milestone in Planet's journey to provide multidimensional Earth insights. The platform brings together new capabilities that improve customers' capacity to analyse and orchestrate large volumes of Earth data, reduce upfront development and maintenance costs, and focus on differentiation.

Users can build insights and solutions, make decisions, and act faster. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Guidelines on the responsible use of generative AI in research developed by the European Research Area Forum](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/guidelines-responsible-use-generative-ai-research-developed-european-research-area-forum-2024-03-20_en). With the rapid spread of AI, these [recommendations](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/2b6cf7e5-36ac-41cb-aab5-0d32050143dc_en) address key opportunities and challenges. Building on the principles of research integrity, they offer guidance to researchers, research organisations, and research funders to ensure a coherent approach across Europe. The key takeaways from the guidelines include that researchers should refrain from using generative AI tools in sensitive activities such as peer reviews or evaluations and use generative AI respecting privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights; research organisations should facilitate the responsible use of generative AI and actively monitor how these tools are developed and used within their organisations; and funding organisations should support applicants in using generative AI transparently.

2. [eCITES receives Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum 2024 innovation award](https://cites.org/eng/news/ecites-receives-aptff-innovation-award-2024). Electronic CITES Permitting Systems ([eCITES](https://cites.org/eng/prog/eCITES)) have catalysed a novel set of collaborative efforts for enhancing trace facilitation and leveraging digitalisation for legal, sustainable, and traceable international wildlife trade. To date, 31 Parties have made considerable strides in implementing eCITES, with an additional 12 Parties in the initial planning phases. Their dedicated efforts have significantly bolstered transparency, curtailed the exploitation of counterfeit permits, facilitated smoother cross-border transactions, and fortified international collaboration.

3. [Advancing sustainable tourism and conservation in Seychelles' Vallée de Mai world heritage site amids adversity](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2670). The COVID-19 pandemic showed the vulnerability of tourism, leading to a drastic decline of over 70% in foreign visitors to Seychelles in 2020. Despite protecting 50% of its terrestrial expanse and 30% of its marine territories, Seychelles continues to face threats to its biodiversity and natural heritage. Climate change, invasive species, forest fires, biodiversity loss from developmental projects, as well as local poaching and illegal fishing activities, demand heightened attention and mitigation efforts. An initiative to enhance sustainable tourism management and conservation within the 'Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve" World Heritage Site, implemented in 2022 - 2023, involved robust statistical visitor management, optimisation of sales performance, and the development of scientific monitoring and visitor engagement applications. A web-based database was developed, providing integrated analysis of visitor metrics and biodiversity surveillance. To improve data acquisition and enrich visitor experiences within the site, a visitor science application was developed for self-guided tours and opportunistic species sighting data collection. This technological innovation not only enhanced visitor engagement but also facilitated the preservation of invaluable ecological data. The official launch of the app took place in February 2024.

4. The Scientific Advice Mechanism of the European Commission [released](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/commission-receives-scientific-advice-artificial-intelligence-uptake-research-and-innovation-2024-04-15_en) its independent policy [recommendations on how to facilitate the uptake of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2a6e3d4f-fae0-11ee-a251-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-315352732) in research and innovation across the EU. The advice is non-binding but may feed into the overall Commission strategy for AI in research and innovation. AI has the potential to revolutionise scientific discovery, accelerate research progress, boost innovation and improve researchers' productivity, and ultimately contribute to solving global societal challenges. On the other hand, it also presents obstacles and risks, for example with obtaining transparent, reproducible results that are essential to robust science in an open society. Furthermore the efficacy of many existing AI models is regarded as compromised by the quality of data used for their training.  

**Indices, indicators and variables**
1. [Planetary variables](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/) are [analysis-ready data feeds that measure important conditions on the surface of the Earth](https://www.planet.com/pulse/measuring-earth-dynamics-with-planetary-variables/) including soil water content, land surface temperature, crop biomass, and forest structure and carbon. They draw on observations from numerous public and commercial satellite missions to generate datasets that have broad, continuous geographic coverage, high-temporal resolution, and a deep archive. The Planetary variables are rigorously tested and validated, and are designed to make Earth observation more accessible by reducing the need to build sophisticated data fusion and machine learning models that translate esoteric datasets into measurements of variables that matter. To analyse the Planetary variables, [Planet Insights Platform](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-insights-platform/) has been developed. It is a cloud-based and API-first platform, and enables performing planetary-scale analyses with multi-temporal statistical analysis of EO data and is designed to analyse deep archives of data.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. OpenAIRE is looking for a [subcontractor to support the implementation of the EOSC Track](https://www.openaire.eu/newsroom), which will develop and operate the European Open Science Observatory, a policy intelligence tool that will monitor policies, investments, digital research outputs, skills and infrastructure. The deadline for the Open Call is the 19th of April, 17:00 CET. The subcontractor is expected to start in May 2024, and finish in November 2027.

2. DataCite and ARDC announced a strategic partnership to deliver RAID, a [service and system to identify and track research projects and activities](https://datacite.org/blog/datacite-ardc-announce-partnership-to-deliver-the-raid-service/). RAID is designed to maintain consistent and up-to-date information on projects throughout the research lifecycle. It provides a unique, persistent identifier for each research project. As the project evolves, information about project personnel, organisations, inputs, and outputs is added to the RAID container, producing a project and capturing information about relationships between resourcing and outcomes.

3. The DataCite Metadata Working Group [has been working](https://datacite.org/blog/metadata-schema-rfc-march_2024/) on [MetaData Schema changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaxTKVO10BoRiBb_nOQY8mlFmhacUBvfk1LicYHnhOA), and are currently [requesting feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaxTKVO10BoRiBb_nOQY8mlFmhacUBvfk1LicYHnhOA). They are specifically looking for comments on languages and translators: making the Language property repeatable and recommended; documentation updates to clarify supported language codes; adding a new dataType Coverage; adding 2 new relatedIdentierTypes RRID and CSTR; adding a new contributorType Translator, adding 2 new relationTypes IsTranslationOf and HasTranslation and adding a new resourceTypeGeneral Project. The deadline for comments is the 6th of May, 2024.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Navigating transport of live animals and plants: CITES online workshop shares best practices, regulations and guidelines](https://cites.org/eng/news/transport-in-live-specimens-cites-online-workshop-2024). Transporting live animals and plants across borders for trade requires navigating a complex system of international regulations and meticulous logistics - from designing species-appropriate containers to taking safe biosecurity measures. To ensure effective regulatory compliance and sustainable transport practices, it is crucial to raise awareness among all stakeholders involved in the transport of live specimens on regulation updates, best practices, and emerging technologies. The workshop recording is available to [watch online here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDv-7I0cxdI).

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Looking back at 2023: a review of the year of IUCN Save Our Species](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2023-our-year-in-review/). Together with the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, more than 20 new projects on species conservation frontlines are supported. The [IUCN Global Species ACtion Plan](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2023-029-En.pdf) was launched, providing a guide for countries to integrate species actions into their national biodiversity strategies and action plans. The introduction of the [latest iteration of the Global Tiger Recovery Progamme](https://globaltigerforum.org/global-tiger-recovery-program-2-0-2023-34/) marked a turning point as it engages key tiger stakeholders in a more targeted manner, both at a high policy level and on the ground. [SOS Lemurs will continue its work in Madagascar until 2029](https://iucnsos.org/sos-lemurs-will-continue-until-2029-thanks-to-9-5-million-chf-extension/), protecting both species and their habitats while also creating livelihood opportunities for the Malagasy people. The [third call for proposals for the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund initiative was held](https://iucnsos.org/third-calls-for-proposals-for-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-now-open-apply-now/), supporting the conservation of threatened freshwater species. The first global freshwater fish assessment carried out by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species showed that 25% of the world's freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction, with 17% of them affected by climate change.

2. The Theme of the World Wildlife Day 2024, on the 3rd of March 2024, was [connecting people and planet: exploring digital innovation in wildlife conservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4J42sAF48&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcites.org%2Feng%2Fnode%2F139499&feature=emb_imp_woyt). Information and communication technologies became powerful instruments for tackling illegal wildlife trade and supporting conservation. UNEP-WCMC designed and maintains the [Species+ website](https://speciesplus.net/) and mobile app, with up-to-date information on the locations, protections and restrictions attached to wildlife listed by CITES and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. On the 3rd of March, UNEP-WCMC launched the [NDF Support Tool](https://ndfsupport.unep-wcmc.org/en), non-detriment findings (NDFs), which science-based decisions about whether international trade in CITES listed-species is detrimental or not, and links together globally important databases on CITES information and endangered species, to help country authorities to conduct the crucial sustainability assessments needed to justify trade in species.

3. [Who pays for conservation? New CITES publication calls for mobilising sustainable finance for African elephants conservation](https://cites.org/eng/mobilizing-sustainable-finance-for-african-elephant-conservation-2023-publication). The African elephant is revered as the largest land mammals and a globally iconic species. However, securing consistent, long-term funding for its conservation within its natural habitats and fostering harmonious cohabitation with humans remains elusive. The financial support required remains largely inadequate, with substantial challenges such as human-elephant conflict, habitat loss, poaching and illegal trade. In a new CITES report, [Mobilising sustainable finance for African elephant conservation](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/prog/elephant/ENGmobilizingSustainableFinanceForAfricanElephantConservation.pdf), various financial mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits, green bonds, wildlife bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, and Conservation Trust Funds to assess their applicability towards African elephant conservation were reviewed.

4. The [14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-at-cop14-supporting-species-recovery-to-achieve-global-biodiversity-goals/) (CMS COP14) took place from February 11 - 17, in Uzbekistan. During the opening of the COP, the first-ever [State of the World's Migratory Species report](https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species) was [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/landmark-un-report-reveals-shocking-decline-in-worlds-migratory-animal-populations) as part of the latest global conference of Parties to the UN Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The report reveals that while some migratory species are improving, 44% are showing population declines, and 22% of CMS-listed species are threatened with extinction. 97% of CMS-listed fish are threatened with extinction. 58% of the monitored sites recognised as being important for CMS-listed species are experiencing unsustainable levels of human-caused pressure, and the 2 greatest threats to both CMS-listed and all migratory species are overexploitation and habitat loss due to human activity. [Collisions with power lines](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/5-surprising-obstacles-to-migratory-animals-journeys) are a threat to migratory birds and bats, as they risk electrocutions, but the power lines also act as a barrier by changing migratory behaviour and flight paths, as some species avoid straight lines.
To protect threatened carnivores, IUCN and the CMS Secretariat [signed a memorandum](https://www.iucn.org/news/202402/iucn-and-convention-migratory-species-secretariat-sign-agreement-mobilize-funds-and) of understanding to raise conservation funds and facilitate the implementation of the African Carnivore Initiative for key carnivore species in Africa: lions, cheetahs, leopards and African wild dogs.  

5.  The [2nd Tiger Programme Workshop](https://iucnsos.org/driving-tiger-conservation-insights-from-the-2nd-tiger-programme-workshop-in-bangkok/) was held in Bangkok, Thailand, to facilitate knowledge sharing and disseminate best practices among our esteemed partners and grantees. Among the participants were representatives and project managers from 14 distinguished organisations spanning tiger range countries and representatives of various IUCN Country offices. Many participants expressed a desire for more frequent workshops and online learning sessions to maintain momentum and expand knowledge sharing.

6. Fondation Segré and IUCN Save Our Species announced the [fourth calls for proposals to protect threatened ungulates](https://iucnsos.org/new-funding-to-protect-threatened-ungulates-now-possible-under-the-fondation-segre-conservation-action-fund-apply-now/). Ungulates contribute significantly to maintaining the health and resilience of our ecosystems, support seed dispersal and germination, and are critical prey species that support the survival of carnivore and scavenger wildlife species. However, poaching, habitat loss and disease threaten the survival of many of these species. The first call for proposals is for conservation action grants: to enable and support civil society organisations engaged in the conservation of globally threatened ungulate species to carry out sustainable conservation measures at local level to protect the species, their habitats and to improve the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. The second is a research support grant to support young and early career scientists in their research to improve knowledge of globally threatened ungulate species and their role in natural ecosystems.

7. [Differences between Global Forest Watch's tree cover loss data and JRC's tropical moist forest data explained](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/tree-cover-loss-and-tropical-moist-forest-data-compared/). The [annual tree cover loss data](https://gfw.global/3BfwQWz) maps forests globally based on tree cover extent in 2000. Tree cover is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum height of at least 5 metres at 30-metre resolution, which includes all types of tree cover. The Global Forest Watch map shows tree cover with a 30% canopy density. The JRC data set includes all closed primary and secondary forests in the humid tropics and does not apply a minimum height or canopy density threshold to delineate forest extent.

8. [New agreement to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence associated with international wildlife trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites-woah-memorandum-of-understanding-2024-zoonotic-disease-emergence). The growing list of emerging zoonoses, emerging diseases that spillover from wildlife to humans, led CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to review the intricate relationship between international wildlife trade and zoonotic diseases, and to discuss the role of the Convention in reducing the risk of future zoonotic disease emergence associated with CITES trade.

9. In ground-breaking research [published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8028), scientists at the UN Environmental Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, [reveal the global distribution of more than 35,000 plant species used by people](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/plants-and-their-contributions-to-people-are-insufficiently-protected-globally). Analysis of the first-ever global map of the diversity and rarity of plant species with documented uses by people has found that the highest concentrations of utilised plants are in the Tropics, and that regions with high concentrations of utilised plant species are largely unprotected.

10. Biodiversity data collection is growing, driven in part by international commitments to conservation, market investments and technological advances and the growing urgency of human impacts including climate change. Nations increasingly rely on biodiversity data in order to strategically meet global conservation targets for the coming decades. But not all data is collected equally. A recent [Science publication](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh8874) shows that biodiversity data is increasingly concentrated in wealthy countries. The authors argue that this context should be unearthed to [prevent inequitable implementation of conservation species](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/unpacking-social-equity-biodiversity-data).

11. [GBIF crossed the significant milestone of logging the 10,000th peer-reviewed journal article using and citing data shared through its network](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data). The [10,000th paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2023.2291133) explores the effects of climate change on rhinoceros populations in Southern Africa, and species occurrence records from the GBIF network to model the future distributions of critically endangered black rhinoceros populations and near threatened white rhinoceros populations in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Botswana, Zambia and Tanzania was used. 

12. [Ending deforestation from cocoa in West Africa with new data-driven resources](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/data-resources-ending-deforestation-cocoa-west-africa/). The global demand for chocolate has had a significant impact on West African forests. Approximately 70% of the global supply of cocoa originates from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, where production sites have replaced millions of hectares of forest. Between 2001 and 2015, cocoa was linked to the loss of a third of Ghana's forest area and a quarter of Côte d’Ivoire's. In 2017, the [Cocoa & Forests Initiative](https://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/initiative/cocoa-forests-initiative/) (CFI) was established in an effort to end cocoa-driven deforestation and restore forest areas. Companies that joined the CFI agreed to map their supply chains, align methodologies on deforestation risk assessment and contribute to transparent monitoring and reporting.

13. Following the first case of Avian Influenza in the Galápagos, which was detected in September 2023 and already caused the death of thousands of birds on the South American mainland and also affected mammals as otters, dolphins and sea lions, the Rapid Response Facility, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre and Fauna and Flora joint initiative has provided 40,000 USD to [support active surveillance of seabird populations](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2668), aiming to understand the extent and limit the spread of the potentially devastating virus. Surveys will be carried out at key breeding colonies of Galápagos penguin, albatross and flightless cormorant populations, and collected samples will be analysed for the identification of Avian Influenza. Findings will be shared with the Galápagos National Park Directorate, to inform management interventions, such as potential tourist restrictions and appropriate quarantine measures for specific areas.

**Climate**
1. The Copernicus Climate Change Service showed that the [global mean temperature from February 2023 to January 2024 was the highest on record](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-january-2024), the whole year was above the 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and the average global sea surface temperature for January reached a temperature of 20.97°C, which is the warmest January on record and the second warmest month, which was August 2023. 

2. [A roots up approach to protecting and restoring our natural capital for the good of people and planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-roots-up-approach-to-protecting-and-restoring-our-natural-capital-people-and-planet/). The world's largest land [conference](https://www.acceleratingnbsconference.org/about-1) took place in Zambia from 11 - 15 March 2024 and brought together a range of voices from the climate community to collaborate on advancing nature-based solutions as a critical part of global climate action. 

3. Aviva, a member of the Finance Sector Deforestation Action (FSDA) and Race to Zero explains why [ending deforestation is a prerequisite for both reversing biodiversity loss and meeting net zero targets](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/aviva-achieving-net-zero-by-addressing-deforestation/). Together with 30 other leading financial institutes that are members of the FSDA, have committed to use their best efforts to eliminate agriculture commodity-driven deforestation in their portfolios by 2025.

4. Climate change around Mount Kilimanjaro is real and has affected local communities. UNESCO and the Kilimanjaro National Park authority have implemented a project titled 'Empowering young women and men for [adaptation to climate change at the Kilimanjaro National Park World Heritage site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2665)'. Through the project, scientific data and traditional knowledge on impacts of climate change were collected. Some key findings included provision of conservation education awareness on climate change, strengthening conservation of forests and discouraging farming to water sources. 

5. [The green bond market, currently at 4 trillion USD, needs to expand tenfold to meet the urgent demands of climate action](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/sean-kidney-the-green-bond-market-needs-to-expand-tenfold-to-meet-the-urgent-demands-of-climate-action/). From a modest beginning of 1.5 billion USD, 15 years ago, the market for green, social, and sustainable bonds has exploded to 4 trillion USD today. One significant hurdle for the transition to greener practices is the confusion about actionable steps, compounded by misinformation, such as the underestimated impact of methane leakage from the gas industry, which has muddled energy investment strategies. 

**Oceans**
1. European scientists have [identified and published 100 crucial questions to advance seagrass conservation and restoration efforts in Europe](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10486), and aim to [fill knowledge gaps and prioritise research](https://goosocean.org/news/scientists-point-the-way-to-enhance-conservation-and-restoration-of-essential-marine-life/) to combat climate change and biodiversity loss in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses play a vital role in our oceans by storing carbon in the seabed, enhancing biodiversity, filtering water, and preventing coastal erosion. However, seagrasses have faced widespread decline worldwide, prompting the need for intensified conservation and restoration efforts.

2. In the case of increasing anthropogenic threats to ecosystems and livelihoods, such as marine pollution, climate change events, and over-exploitation of ocean resources, reshaping our connection with the ocean at all scales and across all of society has become imperative. Through its [Challenge 10: 'Change Humanity's Relationship with the Ocean'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzaPG-cqj3Q), the UN Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (the 'Ocean Decade') aims to [encourage behavioural changes and ensure the impact of solutions in improving humanity's relationship with the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/vision-2030-wg10-redefines-humanitys-relationship-with-the-ocean/).

3. [Maturing the Ocean Enterprise: dialogues with Industry Roadmap unveiled](https://goosocean.org/news/maturing-the-ocean-enterprise-dialogues-with-industry-roadmap-unveiled/), a result of the groundbreaking collaboration involving the Global Ocean Observing System, the Marine Technology Society, The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration and industry representatives. 

4. [Introducing new and improved annual turbidity datasets](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/introducing-annual-turbidity-datasets/). When changes of water quality can be observed visually, such as when the azure waters of a tropical region are engulfed by muddy sediment, this type of measurement of water quality is referred to as 'turbidity'. Turbidity can often indicate places and times when land is overly impacting reefs, and monitoring ocean turbidity in the vicinity of coral reefs has become an important, and still growing, challenge for reef conservationists, managers and scientists. Satellite data was retrospectively analysed, so that long-term average trends can be monitored, identifying chronic turbidity. 

5. [HUB Ocean and WWF partner on data-driven solutions](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/hub-ocean-and-wwf-partner-on-data-solutions-for-ocean-healthnbsp) to current and future risks for the blue economy at the intersection of nature and climate. The partnership will accelerate current and future big data and AI-powered products targeting governments, the private sector, and scientific research benefiting people and nature.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Race to resilience partner initiative wins World Habitat Award for early warning tool](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-resilience-partner-initiatve-wins-world-habitat-award-for-early-warning-tool/). People living in informal urban settlements are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, like storms, floods and heatwaves. Yet, these communities are often unable to access weather information that could help save their lives or prevent devastating damage to their homes and livelihoods. The Developing Risk Awareness through Joint Action ([DARAJA](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/resurgence-unveils-daraja-africas-boldest-urban-early-warning-initiative/?)) is a weather forecasting and early warning system specifically for residents of informal settlements that operates in Kenya and Tanzania, and is currently being developed in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia.

2. [IHME, Microsoft, and Planet collaborate to map climate-vulnerable populations in unprecedented detail](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ihme-microsoft-and-planet-collaborate-to-map-climate-vulnerable-populations-in-unprecedented-detail/). Across the Global South, many cities and regions are growing much more rapidly than their citizens can be counted, leading to settlements that are much larger than their 'official' population counts. For example, Zinder, in Niger, was estimated to grow at more than 5% annually, but has nearly doubled in size since the last official census in 2012. Knowing in detail where people are located is essential to ensure effective humanitarian action when crises strike. 

3. [Planet, Microsoft and researchers build new AI-focused resource for environmental reporting](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-microsoft-and-researchers-build-new-ai-focused-resource-for-environmental-reporting/). In [accelerating biodiversity and ecosystem reporting](https://learn.planet.com/Microsoft-WhitePaper-Gated.html) readers are taken step-by-step through biodiversity and ecosystem reporting, from scoping to assessing and reporting. Concrete examples from industry and the scientific literature demonstrating how recent advances in EO, AI and ecosystem science can help deliver up-to-date and actionable insights for biodiversity and ecosystem metrics, from ecosystem conversion to the state of species.

4. A comprehensive pilot study aims to [globally map sand and dust storms hazards](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/SandDust), employing remote sensing data, advanced Geographic Information System analysis and cutting-edge software such as Google Earth Engine. The primary objective is to create a detailed hazard map, assessing the frequencies, intensities and trends of the sand and dust storm events worldwide. The study also delves into identifying key drivers behind the sand and dust storm events, including climate change, land cover transformations and overgrazing. 

5. Information on hundreds of territories and areas conserved by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, also known as ICCAs or territories of life, is now publicly available. The [ICCA Registry](https://www.iccaregistry.org/) is an [online reporting platform for strengthening evidence on the conservation importance of ICCAs](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/leading-database-on-conservation-by-indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-opens-to-public), alongside increasing global understanding and recognition of these vital areas and their custodians' conservation practices. ICCA custodians can submit a range of information to the ICCA Registry, including geographical data, photos and case studies, and explore how other communities around the world manage and conserve their territories and areas.

6. A [new study published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8) offers an unprecedented view of previously unmapped industrial use of the ocean and how it is changing. The study, led by Global Fishing Watch, uses machine learning and satellite imagery to create the [first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/new-research-harnesses-ai-and-satellite-imagery-to-reveal-the-expanding-footprint-of-human-activity-at-sea/), finding a remarkable amount of activity that was previously 'dark' to public monitoring systems. The analysis reveals that about 75% of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked. More than 25% of transport and energy vessel activity are also missing from public tracking systems. 

7. [GBIF has renewed its successful partnership with DataCamp Donates](https://www.gbif.org/news/yEwhAKzjLvyV7lFZzqqTj/continued-partnership-to-improve-data-literacy-for-gbif-users), enabling data users from across much of its network to access valuable training and improve their data skills. In the past year, 70 GBIF community members completed 115 courses through the learning platform together, covering topics such as programming, data manipulation, probability and statistics, data visualisation and machine learning.

8. [The Copernicus Marine Service launches the Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-ocean-climate-portal). The [Ocean Climate Portal](https://marine.copernicus.eu/ocean-climate-portal) is an innovative platform designed to provide information about our oceans, with a user-friendly interface for accessing a range of ocean  indicators. This presents a significant step forward in our understanding of the impact of climate change on our oceans.

9. [BioEcoOcean - New Horizon EU project to co-create and test a globally applicable blueprint for integrated ocean science](https://www.obis.org/2024/03/13/bioecoocean-new-project/). This comprehensive blueprint will become a tool to guide ocean observing programs from the early planning stages, to data collection, to integrating results into policy and decision making. The blueprint will include data management aspects to facilitate standardisation of ocean observation data, and flow into global repositories like OBIS. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [MapTiler Engine 13.2 is out](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2024/02/effortless-uploads-to-maptiler-cloud-from-maptiler-engine-13-2/), with the possibilities to automate the entire map processing and publishing process from the command line interface.
