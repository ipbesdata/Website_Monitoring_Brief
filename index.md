### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Exploring the vital role of our forests](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/exploring-the-vital-role-of-our-forests). Forests are key to combating climate change, purify water and air, prevent natural disasters (by reducing soil erosion, helping decrease the impact of storm surges and tsunamis and reducing the risk of wildfires), provide soil for agriculture and are home to a wealth of biodiversity (80% of amphibian species, 75% of bird species and 68% of mammal species, and 60% of all vascular plant species occur in tropical forests). 

**Climate**
1. [Leaders urged to heed science and act now to avert climate catastrophe](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/leaders-urged-to-heed-science-and-act-now-to-avert-climate-catastrophe). WWF scientists call on governments to accelerate action to phase out fossil fuels, slash emissions and restore nature.

2. [Marine ecosystems in a changing climate - Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf), a report published by the Ocean & Climate Platform. [Marine ecosystems are critical to climate mitigation and adaptation](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/), and are also increasingly vulnerable to climatic and human stressors, with some already reaching a tipping point. Transformational changes must be carried out to jointly and effectively deploy adaptation and mitigation responses at a large scale, as marine ecosystems provide so many benefits to the living world and are cornerstones of the transition to a more sustainable world.

3. [Climate group: without climate finance for states and regions there can be no net zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/without-climate-finance-for-states-and-regions-there-can-be-no-net-zero-warns-climate-group/). The Climate Group published a [new study](https://www.theclimategroup.org/media/20736/download) discussing mechanisms that state and regional governments can use to raise money to accelerate to net zero and adapt to climate change, and how subnational governments can effectively spend climate finance. As state and regional governments represent over 50% of all environment and climate spending, funding for climate action and policies at subnational level is essential to keep the world on track for 1.5°C of warming. 

4. Race to Zero has released its [Data Explorer](http://www.racetozerodataexplorer.org/), a new [tool, developed by Climate Arc, showcasing climate data from the largest (by revenue) 500 companies in the Race to Zero campaign](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-campaign-launches-new-tool-to-enhance-transparency-of-net-zero-commitments/). Nearly two thirds of the companies published a plan to get to net zero by 2050, and almost 80% published historical emissions data. The tool reveals the differences in quantity and quality of the [data published](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-data-explorer-faqs/), and finds that about 30% of companies are not reporting the full impact of their activities.

5. Although we are way off-target on the commitment to stabilize temperature rises to 1.5°C, there was also some good news in the report, as [the 1.5°C target is still viable](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/exponential-roadmap-initiative-and-now-for-the-good-news-from-the-ipcc-report-the-1-5c-target-is-still-viable/). All solutions are already here, are scalable, can be deployed rapidly, and are affordable. The [key to rapid change is to identify the feedback loops where behavioural change and political, economic and technological shifts create self-reinforcing cycles](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/comment-now-good-news-ipcc-report-15c-target-is-still-viable-2023-03-22/), driving ever-greater action and a green race to the top.

6. [Global, regional and country temperature change statistics from 1961 - 2022](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1635307/) show that [in 2022 the mean annual temperatures were warmer than normal in nearly 85% of all countries and territories for which statistics were available](https://www.fao.org/3/cc5064en/cc5064en.pdf). 


**Oceans**
1. The latest [Allen Coral Atlas impact report reveals the highlights from 2022](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/atlas-2022-impact-report/), including a dynamic [Turbidity dataset](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#turbidity), a new [Coral Reef Extent dataset](https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/nauru-coral-reef-data-allen-coral-atlas), [10 habitat mapping regions with custom improvements](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#habitatmaps) and [integrated Marine Protected Areas](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#mpas).

2. Collective action to create 'the ocean we want', by [officially endorsing 35 new Decade Actions](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-announces-wave-of-over-thirty-new-endorsed-actions/) that are collectively working in all ocean basins, strengthening the global momentum for ocean knowledge-based solutions.

3. The [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) [released its annual list of the top-ten remarkable new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/ten-remarkable-new-marine-species-from-2022/) (out of almost 1,700 marine species, including about 300 fossil species) described in 2022.

4. [Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://oceandecade.org/news/what-ocean-for-tomorrow-marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-change-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/): '[What ocean for tomorrow?](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf)' In the path to a sustainable future, it is crucial to make the protection of the ocean and its ecosystems a priority.

5. [Public and private sectors to advance ocean observing](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=448:public-and-private-sectors-to-advance-ocean-observing&catid=13&Itemid=125): "Today ocean observing activities  mostly rely on public funding, but this will not be sufficient to expand a sustained ocean observing system to meet the growing demands for ocean information." A collaboration between the public and private sectors can bring benefits to both sides across the whole ocean observing value chain. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Forest Watcher updates improve managing teams and reporting on data from the field](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/forest-watcher-mobile-app-updates/). Available data on recently detected tree cover loss and fires, combined with strong existing knowledge from the community, has made investigating potentially illegal clearings and fires within Buen Jardín de Callaru and many other communities across the tropics more efficient.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAire started a podcast](https://www.openaire.eu/let-s-talk-about-open-science) on exploring Open Science principles and practices in Europe, called [Open-ON-AIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/podcasts). In the first episode the human network powering the Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe is being discussed, and the second episode revolves around the OpenAIRE Graph and how it can be used to unlock the power of open science data and create new opportunities. Future episodes will explore a range of topics related to Open Science, their challenges and the sollutions to facilitate the transition towards more responsible and transparent scholarly communication. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The [OpenAIRE webinar on Horizon Europe Open Science requirements in practice](https://www.openaire.eu/unpacking-insights-answering-your-questions).

### News and articles

**Biodiversity**
1. [Understanding the dimensions of the Global Biodiversity Framework and our pathway to the 2030 targets and 2050 vision](https://geobon.org/understanding-the-dimensions-of-the-global-biodiversity-framework-and-our-pathway-to-the-2030-targets-and-2050-vision/). The post-2020 GBF is inarguably the most important piece of global biodiversity legislation in over a decade. A new [paper by Alice Hughes in Integrative Conservation discusses the process, strengths and weaknesses of the GBF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inc3.16).

**Climate**
1. [IPCC lead author Paulina Aldunce: 'What is everyone waiting for?'](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/ipcc-lead-author-paulina-aldunce-what-is-everyone-waiting-for/): The IPCC opened its 58th session to complete the last elements of its [Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/): the synthesis report and its summary for policymakers. The evidence and urgency scientists provide isn't reflected in decision-making.  

2. [Scientists deliver 'final warning' on climate crisis: act now or it's too late](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ipcc-climate-crisis-report-delivers-final-warning-on-15c). The comprehensive review of human knowledge of the climate crisis, the final part of its sixth assessment report, took eight years to compile, and delivers a clear message: act now, or it will be too late.

3. [Traditional air conditioners and refrigerants contain fluorinated gasses that can leak, deplete the ozone layer and harm the environment](https://eia-international.org/climate/sustainable-cooling-technologies/). Sustainable cooling targets efficiency improvements to cooling solutions alongside measures that lower ambient temperatures in buildings and urban environments. [2022 was the hottest year on record](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130237), and as the atmosphere warms, heatwaves, soaring temperatures, droughts and other weather extremes are becoming more frequent and more intense. [Sustainable cooling can help tackle the climate crisis](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-sustainable-cooling-and-how-can-it-help-tackle-the-climate-crisis/). 

4. [COP28 presidency launches bid called 'International Youth Climate Delegate Program' to put climate vulnerable youth at the center of climate talks](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/cop28-launches-program-to-put-marginalised-youth-at-the-centre-of-climate-talks/), stating: 'We may not know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future. It is you - our young people.' The objectives of the program include ensuring that youth views and proposals are fully integrated into global climate policymaking and dialogues; building youth skills, capacity, knowledge and networks, particularly in the most impacted countries, to engage in climate processes and providing a model for the COP process on youth inclusion. [People between 18 and 35, who demonstrate a commitment to climate issues and ideally have experience in the area, can apply to participate in the program until the 7th of April](https://www.cop28.com/en/youth-program).

**Oceans**
1. [Investor coalition to engage seafood sector on key nature risks](https://sustainablebrands.com/read/finance-investment/investor-coalition-engage-seafood-sector-key-nature-risks). New [WWF research](https://www.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Seafood-AM-Report.pdf) shows some banks and investors recognize the potential for environmental, social and governance risks in seafood but most lack robust or actionable policies, as fewer than 5% acknowledge having a process to identify the impacts of their financing activities on nature.

2. [The Global Fund for Coral Reefs](https://globalfundcoralreefs.org/) is a 10-year, $625 million coalition between UN agencies, financial institutions and private philanthropy sources, which supports [business models that can sustainably finance key conservation and development goals for coral reefs via two initiative funds](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/welcoming-the-global-fund-for-coral-reefs-to-the-race-to-resilience/); the grant fund, which provides technical assistance, capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, and the investment fund that generates de-risked investment capital to maximize the impact of projects incubated by the grant fund. 

3. [Why the High Seas Treaty is a breakthrough for the ocean and the planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/why-the-high-seas-treaty-is-a-breakthrough-for-the-ocean-and-the-planet/). The High Seas Treaty includes an agreement to impose strict protection of the ocean outside national borders and rules for the sustainable use of its resources, to ensure that we are not depleting ocean ecosystems and stipulates that environmental impact assessments must be completed before any new exploitation of marine resources in areas beyond national jurisdictions, and features provisions to allow for equitable sharing of knowledge, technologies and benefits from marine genetic resources. 

4. [Where is your squid coming from? Most likely unregulated waters, according to a new international study](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/where-squid-coming-likely-unregulated-waters-new-study/). Scientists and policymakers have voiced growing concerns about the decline of global squid stocks, but [little has been done to date to target squid fishing activities that are expanding into unregulated species](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8125). Using satellite imagery, vessel tracking and data monitoring, the study found that the fishing conducted by the globalized light-luring squid fishery was extensive, fishing between 149,000 and 151,000 vessel days annually, and that effort increased 68% over the study period from 2017 - 2020.

5. A [new Horizon EU project aims to identify the locations within the European seas where marine protected areas would protect the highest number of species, habitats and ecosystems](https://www.obis.org/2023/03/10/MPA_europe/). This information will support stakeholders involved in marine spatial planning in establishing effective conservation areas. 

**New platforms and initiatives**

1. GEO BON is developing an online platform, 'Bon in a Box' ([introduced with a short (3 minute) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLjnjCWwU3w)) that will help countries assess the information they have and guide monitoring to improve knowledge of the trends in biodiversity. There is a [one question questionnaire to assess interest of potential users and contributors](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexJu0obGMgMXZYyN4UNgw7LPTsrjhklogvk8YSgW2Mk5DoHg/viewform). 

2. The European Commission adopted the [Euratom Work Programme 2023 - 2025 ](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/57d8f069-9d63-4c55-a56d-53b4b9fad04b_en) implementing the [Euratom Research and Training Programme and supporting nuclear researchers with €132 million](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/researchers-receive-eu132-million-through-new-euratom-research-and-training-work-programme-2023-2025-2023-03-17_en) in funding. This [call for proposals will focus on the safety of Small Modular Reactors, development of nuclear materials and the secure management and disposal of radioactive waste](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,0;statusCodes=31094501;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=43298916;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState). 

3. [Planet's satellite data will be leveraged to enhance a unique monitoring solution for the defense and intelligence sector](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-and-preligens-partner-to-achieve-near-persistent-monitoring-for-defense-intelligence-analysts/), solving a critically needed data processing gap, accelerating the intelligence cycle and increasing overall situational awareness.

4. The [2023 UN Small Island Developing States Partnerships Awards are now accepting applications](https://sdgs.un.org/SIDSPartnershipsAwards) from all stakeholders. The deadline for applications is on the 28th of April, and the laureates of the Awards will be invited to New York in July 2023 at the Awards ceremony. 

5. The Joint Research Centre through he BIOPAMA program launched a [Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) focused on 'Assessing tourism services in protected areas: value chain and economic analyses'](https://mooc-conservation.org/courses/course-v1:mooc-conservation+01+2022/about), aiming to enable park managers, nature conservation agencies and other stakeholders to improve their capacity in assessing the tourism activities related to their protected areas and their economic and financial impacts. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Generative AI and the unceasing acceleration of academic writing](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/03/14/generative-ai-and-the-unceasing-acceleration-of-academic-writing/). The launch of ChatGPT has galvanized a debate around how it could or should be used in research and teaching. Mark Carrigan argues that the dynamic of ChatGPT and generative AIs as efficiency tools opens the door to further growth and acceleration in research outputs, but also raises questions about the value of these products of academic labour. For example, Science and Springer Nature have prohibited that ChatGPT was credited as a co-author on papers. Science's editor-in-chief argued that text produced by Chat-GPT would be seen as plagiarism whereas Nature has allowed their use under specific documented circumstances.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1.  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was opened for the world's governments for signature 50 years ago, on 3 March, 1973. Since then, its membership grew from 10 to 184 Parties, who [work together to ensure that animals and plants will not go extinct in the wild by regulating international wildlife trade, thereby guaranteeing that it is legal, sustainable and traceable](https://cites.org/eng/news/celebrating-50-years-of-cites). Roughly 3 months after the CoP19 in Panama City, [hundreds of species are accorded new regulatory measures](https://cites.org/eng/news/new-cites-trade-rules-come-into-effect). There are now [almost 40,000 species listed and therefore regulated under the Convention](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/celebrating-partnerships-for-conservation), ranging from elephants, crocodiles and tigers, to corals, caviar, orchids and high-value timbers. 10 Years ago on the 3rd of March, was the first World Wildlife Day, and this year on that date, the [legislation to create a U.S. Foundation for International Conservation, that would fund public-private partnerships designed to support large-scale conservation and effective protected area management around the world](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-statement-on-legislation-to-create-a-u-s-foundation-for-international-conservation) while also benefiting local communities, was reintroduced. 

2. To eliminate overfishing, illegality and habitat conversion from seafood value chains, a new collaboration of five conservation and biodiversity-focused organizations launched [an initiative that will leverage the power of investors to engage seafood companies on critical nature and biodiversity related impacts and risks](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-investor-collaboration-will-engage-the-seafood-sector-on-key-nature-risks-and-impacts).

3. To [safeguard tropical Africa's iconic species, let's preserve their close relationship with local communities](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2527). Over time, rainforest communities in Africa have developed a close relationship with umbrella species (iconic and/or threatened species, whose conservation also protects a wide range of flora and fauna that occur in the same habitat), such as great apes and elephants. This relationship is expressed in various cultural practices that are passed down from generation to generation. Several African governments are considering the inclusion of these practices and beliefs in the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage.

4. [Review reveals how biodiversity data supports research on human diseases](https://www.gbif.org/news/11OGVaJcueG829KraUfezA/review-reveals-how-biodiversity-data-supports-research-on-human-diseases), highlighting the possible benefits of better coordination on data sharing around global disease surveillance. 

**Climate**
1. To limit global warming, [ocean-based solutions have the potential to reduce the emissions-gap by up to 21%](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/gigawatt-dreams-to-reality-realizing-the-potential-of-offshore-wind-to-avert-a-climate-crisis/) by 2050: Coastal ecosystems can sequester large amounts of carbon, aquatic food production can provide low-carbon protein to the worlds' growing population, and offshore wind energy, which has the potential to provide more than enough energy to power the world four times over.

2. There is [no Paris Agreement without protecting, restoring, sustaining and managing nature, and this cannot be done without Indigenous Peoples, youth and finance](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/razan-al-mubarak-there-is-no-paris-agreement-without-protecting-restoring-sustaining-and-managing-nature/).

3. A new method was developed to use [deep learning and natural language processing to extract mentions of risk factors of food insecurity from text](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/predicting-food-crisis-outbreaks-using-natural-language-processing-news-streams) of more than 11 million news articles about food-insecure countries published between 1980 and 2020. Almost 170 relevant keywords and phrases were discovered (such as 'drought', 'raising food prices' and 'pests'. Risk indicators of food insecurity were developed based on the occurrence of these keywords in news articles. A machine learning model has been developed that incorporates these news indicators to generate monthly district-level predictions. These predictions can be used to prioritize the allocation of emergency food assistance.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAIRE Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/) is an open resource that aggregates a collection of research data properties within the OpenAIRE Open Science infrastructure. The Graph is one of the largest and most heterogeneous collections of scholarly metadata for research products. A [roadmap with 5 future goals for the Graph was developed](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-graph-steadily-riding-the-wild-wave-of-open-science): 1) make the Graph well-developed and developer-friendly, 2) Make the Graph more interoperable, 3) Improve its coverage, 4) improve content quality and transparency and 5) make it easy to query and maintain.

2. The [results of the OpenAIRE survey 'Who is managing research data?](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-survey-who-is-managing-research-data), which has been filled out by 18 people. Based on the answers, proper research data management is being done by a wide variety of roles, often in an informal capacity. 

3. [Three reasons we should place a higher value on meta-research](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/02/23/three-reasons-we-should-place-a-higher-value-on-meta-research/) (investigating the process and norms of how knowledge is generated): it provides a high-level synthesis,  and is balanced and introspective.

2. Connecting nature in a fragmented world: [the importance of conserving ecological connectivity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/connecting-nature-in-a-fragmented-world-the-importance-of-conserving-ecological-connectivity-in-the-next-decade) in the next decade. The [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf) was officially adopted at COP15. [Data on fish catch and the number of supply chain certification holders by country are official indicators in the framework](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2022/12/20/msc-standards-become-un-indicators-in-landmark-deal-to-preserve-global-biodiversity) for 2 of its 23 targets: on sustainable management and trade of wild species, and on the integration of biodiversity values into economics. The [insider's perspectives of the points of view of directors, scientists and fisheries](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2022/12/22/cop-15-an-insider-s-perspective) were shared in an article on the Marine Stewardship Council website.    

3. A new study '[Mapping the planet's critical natural assets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01934-5)', demonstrating how nature conservation contributes to human well-being at local and global scales, was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.  

**Climate**
1. Climate-smart and regenerative food systems can lead the race to achieve net zero, nature positive results by 2030. [Three industry leaders explain what regenerative agriculture is](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-regenerative-agriculture-and-how-can-it-help-us-get-to-net-zero-food-systems-3-industry-leaders-explain/), and how it will help to get to net zero foodsystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [ENCORE biodiversity module](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) is an extension of the ENCORE tool, a powerful database  enabling financial institutions to identify nature-related risks in their activities, helps [assess risks in the agricultural sector](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/spotlight-on-biodiversity-risk-in-the-agriculture-sector) by enabling financial institutions to assess to what extent their financial activities are potentially driving species extinction risk and ecological integrity risk. The module then provides guidance on the minimum level of biodiversity management practices required in order to be considered aligned with global biodiversity goals.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. A new paper '[Extending the CARE principles from tribal research policies to benefit sharing in genomic research](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/637acdc59cc1b65057118e99/1668992455706/fgene-13-1052620.pdf)' was published in Frontiers in Genetics.

**Online courses**
1. [Using spatial data for biodiversity](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/using-spatial-data-for-biodiversity/#learndash-course-content): a free 4-hour course, divided in 3 lessons, on the value of remote sensing for monitoring biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, using the UN Biodiversity Lab to visualize and analyze spatial data, and gain an understanding of how spatial data is used in conservation planning. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Insiders series: big cats and biodiversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyvriMaMPpE). In 2010, when the global wild tiger population was at an all-time low, 13 tiger-range countries worked together to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. This webinar, by WWF's senior vice president for wildlife conservation Ginette Hemley as part of the WWF Conservation Insiders Series, addresses the lessons learned from these conservation efforts, and how the same model could be used to save other big cat species, such as jaguars, snow leopards and lions.

2. Copyright for Open Science Series Workshop 1: [The European context of copyright reform for Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dv_knKXiUM), outlining the current copyright initiatives and reforms that hold promise for expediting and incentivizing the move to open science.
