**Biodiversity**
1. The [Big Cat Public Safety Act Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2022/12/20/press-release-bills-signed-h-r-263-h-r-1193-h-r-5796-h-r-7077-s-198-s-231-s-1617-s-2796-s-3092-s-3115-s-3499-s-3662-s-3875/), which will provide oversight on captive tigers in the U.S., including a ban on public contact (such as taking photos with a tiger or cub petting), [was signed](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3784218-why-does-the-new-law-on-tigers-matter-there-are-more-in-the-us-than-the-wild/) at the end of December 2022.

2. Connecting nature in a fragmented world: [the importance of conserving ecological connectivity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/connecting-nature-in-a-fragmented-world-the-importance-of-conserving-ecological-connectivity-in-the-next-decade) in the next decade. The [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf) was officially adopted at COP15. [Data on fish catch and the number of supply chain certification holders by country are official indicators in the framework](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2022/12/20/msc-standards-become-un-indicators-in-landmark-deal-to-preserve-global-biodiversity) for 2 of its 23 targets: on sustainable management and trade of wild species, and on the integration of biodiversity values into economics. The [insider's perspectives of the points of view of directors, scientists and fisheries](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2022/12/22/cop-15-an-insider-s-perspective) were shared in an article on the Marine Stewardship Council website.    

3. A new study '[Mapping the planet's critical natural assets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01934-5)', demonstrating how nature conservation contributes to human well-being at local and global scales, was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.  

**Climate**
1. Climate-smart and regenerative food systems can lead the race to achieve net zero, nature positive results by 2030. [Three industry leaders explain what regenerative agriculture is](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-regenerative-agriculture-and-how-can-it-help-us-get-to-net-zero-food-systems-3-industry-leaders-explain/), and how it will help to get to net zero foodsystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [ENCORE biodiversity module](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) is an extension of the ENCORE tool, a powerful database  enabling financial institutions to identify nature-related risks in their activities, helps [assess risks in the agricultural sector](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/spotlight-on-biodiversity-risk-in-the-agriculture-sector) by enabling financial institutions to assess to what extent their financial activities are potentially driving species extinction risk and ecological integrity risk. The module then provides guidance on the minimum level of biodiversity management practices required in order to be considered aligned with global biodiversity goals.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. A new paper '[Extending the CARE principles from tribal research policies to benefit sharing in genomic research](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/637acdc59cc1b65057118e99/1668992455706/fgene-13-1052620.pdf)' was published in Frontiers in Genetics.

**Online courses**
1. [Using spatial data for biodiversity](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/using-spatial-data-for-biodiversity/#learndash-course-content): a free 4-hour course, divided in 3 lessons, on the value of remote sensing for monitoring biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, using the UN Biodiversity Lab to visualize and analyze spatial data, and gain an understanding of how spatial data is used in conservation planning. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Insiders series: big cats and biodiversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyvriMaMPpE). In 2010, when the global wild tiger population was at an all-time low, 13 tiger-range countries worked together to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. This webinar, by WWF's senior vice president for wildlife conservation Ginette Hemley as part of the WWF Conservation Insiders Series, addresses the lessons learned from these conservation efforts, and how the same model could be used to save other big cat species, such as jaguars, snow leopards and lions.

2. Copyright for Open Science Series Workshop 1: [The European context of copyright reform for Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dv_knKXiUM), outlining the current copyright initiatives and reforms that hold promise for expediting and incentivizing the move to open science.
