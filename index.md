**Biodiversity**
1. For everyone in the US: '[Our planet live in concert](https://www.ourplanetinconcert.com/usa/home), the highlights of the 'Our Planet' series featuring the greatest wildlife spectacles on earth, accompanied by a live orchestra, is going on tour in February.

2. [2022 was a historic year for conserving species: a review](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2022-our-year-in-review/), including: a doubling of numbers of tigers in the wild in Nepal, the release of three orphaned Javan gibbons in Indonesia and the placing of 20 nest boxes in Bolivia which are key for the Red-fronted Macaws, which are critically endangered, to breed. 

3. [Archiving animal movements as a record of biodiversity](https://oscibio.inbo.be/blog/move2gbif/). While tens of thousands of animals are monitored with GPS trackers, the collected data is seldom available on platforms used for biodiversity research. A new workflow has been developed to make GPS tracking data available in biodiversity data portals, which is currently used to archive tracking data for hundreds of oystercatchers across northwest Europe as a test case.

3. A new study '[Mapping the planet's critical natural assets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01934-5)', demonstrating how nature conservation contributes to human well-being at local and global scales, was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.  

**Climate**
1. Climate-smart and regenerative food systems can lead the race to achieve net zero, nature positive results by 2030.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [ENCORE biodiversity module](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) is an extension of the ENCORE tool, a powerful database  enabling financial institutions to identify nature-related risks in their activities, helps [assess risks in the agricultural sector](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/spotlight-on-biodiversity-risk-in-the-agriculture-sector) by enabling financial institutions to assess to what extent their financial activities are potentially driving species extinction risk and ecological integrity risk. The module then provides guidance on the minimum level of biodiversity management practices required in order to be considered aligned with global biodiversity goals.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. A new paper '[Extending the CARE principles from tribal research policies to benefit sharing in genomic research](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/637acdc59cc1b65057118e99/1668992455706/fgene-13-1052620.pdf)' was published in Frontiers in Genetics.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Insiders series: big cats and biodiversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyvriMaMPpE). In 2010, when the global wild tiger population was at an all-time low, 13 tiger-range countries worked together to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. This webinar, by WWF's senior vice president for wildlife conservation Ginette Hemley as part of the WWF Conservation Insiders Series, addresses the lessons learned from these conservation efforts, and how the same model could be used to save other big cat species, such as jaguars, snow leopards and lions.

2. Copyright for Open Science Series Workshop 1: [The European context of copyright reform for Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dv_knKXiUM), outlining the current copyright initiatives and reforms that hold promise for expediting and incentivizing the move to open science.
