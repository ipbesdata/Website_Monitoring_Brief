**Biodiversity**
1. On the 22nd of May it was the [international day for Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/idb/). The theme this year was 'From agreement to action: build back biodiversity', and it called on communities at all scales to step up and show their commitment to moving from the agreement of new targets for nature to action, so that these commitments can be realised. [CITES sent its congratulations for the historical agreement on the Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V5dq_R9vB0). The director-general of [UNESCO addressed the urgency of tackling the challenge of preserving nature and its living fabric](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2565), as she points out that there are barely two years left to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century. Failure to do so would be a failure to preserve the habitability of our world and the diversity of species that inhabit it. 

2. On Biodiversity Day 2023 the [vital links between biodiversity and global trade and how both impact the resilience and well-being of communities around the world](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/reflecting-on-the-crucial-co-dependance-of-biodiversity-and-international-trade) were explored. About 30 percent of threats to species globally are driven by international trade, and nearly 70 percent of tropical deforestation is due to commercial agriculture, from which most of the products are traded internationally. Although trade in natural and agricultural goods is a key driver of economic growth, it can also result in the depletion of wild animal and plant populations. For example, the palm oil industry has positively contributed to smallholders' wellbeing and financial security, but the commercial plantations in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa have resulted in land degradation, affecting other crops and wild species. The loss of biodiversity also exacerbates the effects of climate change, as deforestation releases greenhouse gasses and reduces the environment's ability to buffer and recover from extreme weather events.

3. Also on Biodiversity Day, the [National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans Forum 2.0](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/nbsap-forum/elearning/) was [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/nbsap-forum-2-0-launches-to-help-nations-meet-2030-targets-for-nature), an online platform for biodiversity experts working on national efforts towards the latest internationally agreed targets for nature. Via the Forum 2.0, UNEP-WCMC provides countries with technical support, learning and guidance materials to help them understand and incorporate new targets, develop clear financing plans for implementation and prepare for national monitoring.

4. [WWF report highlights 380 new species discoveries in the Greater Mekon region](https://asiapacific.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/new_species_discoveries/new_species_discoveries_2021_2022/), Southeast Asia, in 2021 and 2022. Many of these new (to science) species are under threat of extinction, and [WWF is calling for an increase of protection for these species and their habitats](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-report-highlights-380-new-species-discoveries-in-the-greater-mekong-region). 

5. Grasslands are essential to livelihoods and food security, and critical for biodiversity and nature, holding approximately one third of global terrestrial carbon stocks and providing critical resilience in the face of climate change. However, more than 70% of America's prairies have been destroyed. A [new brief from WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/saving-our-grasslands-why-they-matter-why-we-are-losing-them-and-how-we-can-save-them) details [policy actions](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-outlines-policy-actions-to-save-grasslands) the US government must take to conserve grassland prairie habitats.

6. [UNEP-WCMC welcomed the launch of new private sector guidance on setting targets for nature](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-welcomes-launch-of-nature-targets-and-guidance-for-businesses), released by a major global consortium of conservation and development organisations and finance and sustainability experts, called [the Science Based Targets Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/). The new targets expand the existing Science Based Targets for climate, and address impacts on ecosystems through reducing conversion and land occupation, encouraging landscape level engagement and tackling water consumption and pollution. 

7. The UK's largest insurance company, Aviva, demonstrates a [strong commitment to address environmental issues, particularly deforestation and biodiversity loss with a £38m to restore lost temperate rainforests in the UK](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/avivas-biodiversity-efforts-continue-with-38m-pledge-to-restore-lost-uk-rainforests/), by planting a combination of native tree species and supporting the Woodland Carbon Scheme, which aims to deliver carbon removal, boost air quality and improve biodiversity through woodland creation and peat restoration. 

**Climate**
1. [Navigating the complex world of carbon markets: the path to high-quality credits for ecosystem restoration](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/navigating-the-complex-world-of-carbon-markets-the-path-to-high-quality-credits-for-ecosystem-restoration). The voluntary carbon market enables private actors to finance greenhouse gas removal or abatement activities outside regulated or mandatory carbon pricing instruments, and facilitates the generation and trading of carbon credits and offsetting of carbon emissions. Its increased popularity led to increased scrutiny and calls for transparency, to ensure that genuine contributions to climate change mitigation are being delivered.

2. An international group of fourteen experts from different backgrounds are going [to prepare a report building the evidence base for how action tackling both the climate emergency and sustainable development challenges synergistically can be a win-win solution, maximizing impact](https://sdgs.un.org/blog/expert-group-prepare-report-analysing-climate-and-sdg-synergies-aiming-maximize-action-impact).

3. [Major companies push for a net zero nature-positive world](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/redefining-corporate-responsibility-major-companies-push-for-a-net-zero-nature-positive-world/) by recognising the importance of mitigating their own environmental impact, advocating for systemic change and inspiring others to follow suit. 

**Oceans**
1. California has one of the most extensive networks of Marine Protected Areas in the world. The important question now is: is it working? NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis) is leading a [ten-year review of California's MPA network](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/MPA-decadal-review), which is also addressing the [legacy of exclusion of Indigenous perspectives and priorities](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=207753&inline) as well as the [Nature Futures Framework](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10146), which is designed to emphasize positive human-nature relationships.  

2. [Tropical cyclones: why we must observe the ocean to better protect people on land](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=454:tropical-cyclones-why-we-must-observe-the-ocean-to-better-protect-people-on-land&catid=13&Itemid=125). In 2011 Hurricane Irene was supposed to be a devastating storm, but fizzled out. In 2012, when the alerts about Hurricane Sandy came up, it was very difficult to convince people of the powerfulness of the storm. Underwater vehicles collecting ocean observations were deployed during both these events. Since 2018, the data collected from these underwater vehicles is included into hurricane forecast models, contributing to timely and more accurate warnings. 

3. The Fisherman Weather Field School, a project under the UN Ocean Decade Observing Together programme, helps fishermen to use ocean information to protect themselves and save lives in their communities by [bridging the gap between ocean data and users in local fishing communities, improving ocean literacy and enabling fishers to use ocean and weather information](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=455:ocean-information-is-saving-lives-in-indonesian-coastal-communities&catid=13&Itemid=125) in their daily activities. 

4. Sargassum, a type of free-floating seaweed typically found in the Sargasso Sea, has caused significant ecological and economic problems in recent years due to its rapid growth and spread. Changes in ocean currents have driven the seaweed to new areas, and the increase in dissolved carbon dioxide levels, an influx of nutrients from the Amazon and Congo Rivers and strong converging winds leading to exposure to high sunlight are possibly promoting their growth. Large accumulations of sargassum have been increasingly causing environmental and socio-economic problems in recent years, particularly along the Caribbean and West African coasts, as dense mats of seaweed smother coral reefs and seagrass beds, depriving them of sunlight and oxygen, which in turn declines marine life, such as fish, crustaceans and other organisms that rely on these habitats for food and shelter. The seaweed entangles fishing gear and boats and hinder the nesting of sea turtles. Additionally, thick layers of decaying seaweed release foul odours and produce hydrogen sulphide gas, which can be harmful to humans and wildlife, and deters tourists. The [Sargassum Operational Detection Algorithms (SODA) project, aims to monitor and track sargassum](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sargassum-invasion-combating-seaweed-crisis-copernicus-marine-data). Satellite imagery, provided by Copernicus, will be used for SODA, with the end goal to provide reliable and accurate data to stakeholders, so that informed decisions for sargassum management and mitigation efforts can be made.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [Zero Food Waste Coalition](https://zerofoodwastecoalition.org/) released [Achieving Zero Food Waste: A State Policy Toolkit](https://zerofoodwastecoalition.org/state-toolkit/), highlighting [opportunities for state actors to accelerate their leadership on food waste reduction policy](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/zero-food-waste-coalition-highlights-state-policy-opportunities-to-reduce-food-waste). 

2. [WWF is calling for a global ban on harmful and unnecessary single-use plastic items](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-calls-for-a-global-ban-on-harmful-and-unnecessary-single-use-plastic-items-such-as-vapes-cutlery-and-cosmetic-microplastics-ahead-of-key-un-plastic-pollution-treaty-talks), such as vapes, cutlery and cosmetic microplastics among others, ahead of the UN plastic pollution treaty talks taking place in Paris from May 29th to June 2nd 2023. 

3. Modeled after the success of the Ocean Health Index, the [Western Wildlife Resilience Index](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/announcing-WWRI), the first holistic quantitative metric of wildfire resilience, was developed, to enhance decision making and improve the management and well-being of ecosystems and communities.

4. Planet officially launched their [Startup Program](https://www.planet.com/startup/) which enables [early-stage startups to build novel applications powered by Planet's data](https://www.planet.com/startup/), by offering discounted access to Planet data for R&D, product development, and prototyping purposes to help make global change visible, accessible and actionable. 

5. The 2022 SDG Progress Report suggested that progress toward many of the targets that underpin the SDGs has stalled or even gone backwards. One of the critical barriers has been that the level of investment and financial support for the SDGs has not been sufficient, the bap between required and delivered investment was estimated to approximately USD 3.9 trillion. [The private finance sector is increasingly interested in sustainability issues and the SDGs](https://sdg-action.org/learning-from-climate-finance/): over 4,500 asset owners and asset managers are signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment and over 300 banks (representing almost half of the global banking industry) are signatories to the Principles for Responsible Banking, thereby committing to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment and lending practices, and to engage with companies to encourage better management of these ESG factors. Governments need to focus on addressing the barriers to capital investment in emerging economies and to establish and implement SDG delivery plans that encourage meaningful action on the SDGs across economic sectors. [Blended finance involves the targeted use of concessional financing to attract new sources of investment in projects that may otherwise be perceived as too risky for private finance](https://sdg-action.org/unlocking-the-potential-of-blended-finance/), as it improves the [risk-return characteristics of an investment by pooling capital with different financial and non-financial return expectations](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-it-takes-to-attract-private-investment-to-climate-adaptation/) within an investment structure. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) provides a useful guide to the impact of blended finance and how its potential can be further unlocked. In addition to climate change mitigation, the GEF has applied blended finance to address and accelerate nature-based solutions related to land, water, biodiversity and resilience.

1. On Saturday May 13th it was [World Migratory Bird Day](https://www.worldmigratorybirdday.org/news/2023/press-release-world-migratory-bird-day-2023-highlights-impact-growing-water-crisis), a global campaign that aims to raise awareness of migratory birds and the need for international cooperation to conserve them. This year, [the importance of water for migratory birds and calls to protect water resources and aquatic ecosystems were highlighted](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2559).

2. [Combating the illegal trade in big cats - 28 countries come together as part of CITES Big Cats Task Force](https://cites.org/eng/news/combating-the-illegal-trade-in-big-cats-28-countries-come-together-as-part-of-cites-big-cats-task-force_04052023), focusing on big cat species that are of highest concern from a conservation and illegal trade perspective: cheetah, mainland clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard, lion, jaguar, leopard, tiger and snow leopard. Big cats are affected by illegal international trade and have been targeted for their furs, teeth, bones and other body parts, as well as for live animal trade. The [outcome from the CITES Big Cats Task Force meeting](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/EST/Big_Cat_Task_Force_Final_outcome_document.pdf) will be presented to the 77th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, in November 2023.

3. A [new interactive website showcasing the latest scientific research on the health of and the benefits provided by four important marine systems, kelp, coral reefs, seagrass meadows and mangroves](https://www.unep.org/interactives/why-blue-ecosystems-matter/) was [launched by the UN Environmental Programme](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/understanding-how-mangrove-loss-threatens-biodiversity). 

4. [Accessing GBIF-mediated occurrence data to conserve evolutionary distinct and globally endangered (EDGE) species](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/accessing-occurrence-data-to-conserve-edge-species/) in a exploratory study looking at data availability and species occurrence identification outside existing protected areas for EDGE species in Benin, Ecuador and Vietnam. The majority of EDGE species had data available in GBIF, and the lower percentage of occurrence records available outside protected areas suggest either a sampling bias within protected areas or a concentration of those species within protected areas. 

**Climate**
1. [UNFF Director Juliette Biao: 'Sustainable forest management critical to undoing centuries of damage'](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/unff-director-juliette-biao-sustainable-forest-management-critical-to-undoing-centuries-of-damage/). Despite the immense value of forests, as carbon sinks, part of the hydrological cycle, and habitat to 80% of all land-based species, 420 million hectares of forest were lost over the last two decades. Over half of the loss is due to conversion of forest land into cropland and livestock grazing accounts for almost 40%. The key challenge is how to manage the ongoing increase in agricultural production, and improve food security, without reducing overall forest areas.

**Oceans**
1. [26 Ocean biodiversity and bycatch reduction projects recipients of annual MSC research grants](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/05/10/ocean-biodiversity-and-bycatch-reduction-projects-among-recipients-of-annual-msc-research-grants) of nearly $1 million that will better protect the ocean and support sustainable fishing. One project will help the protection of loggerhead sea turtles in the waters around the island of Réunion, where to date more than 400 turtles have been rescued who got accidently injured by fishing.

**News and updates about applications**
1. MapTiler has been creating a comprehensive mapping ecosystem for businesses, including advanced processing tools like Desktop/Engine, data storage and processing services, QGIS plugins, geocoding and geolocation services, JavaScript libraries, map styling tools and more. Now they created their own software development kit, and [provide a comprehensive explanation and tutorial](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2023/05/maptiler-sdk-javascript-maps-on-steroids/). 

**Indices and indicators**

It currently supports more than 300,000 researchers in more than 7500 research organisations in 153 countries, and is a core enabler of open science practice by providing trusted long-term storage. 

2. [What is responsible knowledge exchange, engagement and impact?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/05/03/what-is-responsible-knowledge-exchange-engagement-and-impact/) A framework was developed to understand and develop responsible knowledge exchange, engagement and impact, including: 1. integrity and ethics, by being attentive to whether there is sufficient formal or informal reflection and scrutiny of ethical issues in setting up, conducting and drawing benefits from projects, 2. equity, diversity and inclusion, such as the need for greater focus and scrutiny of the power asymmetries and barriers, 3. sustainability and reciprocity, 4. contextual sensitivity across different cultures and across experiential contexts, 5. sharing and openness, for example regarding the protection of the confidentiality of participants and preserving relationships of trust, and 6. support and recognition. These ideas will be developed into workshops, publications, resources and a follow-up project, and [ideas and collaborations are welcomed](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/alis-oancea/).

3. [Does generative AI contribute to more culturally inclusive higher education and research?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/05/04/bridge-or-barrier-does-generative-ai-contribute-to-more-culturally-inclusive-higher-education-and-research/) Chat GPT is already a good translator across various languages, which holds promise for intercultural communication, as it might lower the publishing barrier for early researchers with lower levels of English proficiency.

The Kennedy Center's [River Run festival](https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/festivals-series/riverrun/) featured a set of life-size statues of rhinos called 'Survivors'. Although they are not considered to be aquatic animals, they can be thought of as river-dependent.

On the 1st of May, 2023, the [new MSC's Fisheries Standard](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/05/01/msc-fisheries-standard-version-3.0-comes-into-effect) became operational, which ensures that certified fisheries continue to be recognised as global leaders in sustainability and the protection of marine resources for future generations. 

2. The [Strategy for Reef Resilience in Belize was launched](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2551), in order to help safeguard the future of the [Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/764) from the impacts of climate change.

3. According to estimations, there are 2.2 million species in our oceans, but only 240,000 have been scientifically described. To accelerate species discovery, the [Ocean Census programme has been launched](https://www.revocean.org/oceancensus/), which aims to identify at least 100,000 new marine species in the next decade.

4. Fishing grounds off the coast of West Africa are some of the richest and most diverse in the world. The fishery sector is an important contributor to economic productivity. However, coastal fisheries are increasingly threatened by overfishing, unsustainable management practices and high levels of post-harvest losses, putting local livelihoods, food security and marine biodiversity at risk. Therefore, [MSC partners with FAO to promote sustainable use and management of coastal fisheries in Cabo Verde](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/04/19/msc-partners-with-fao-to-promote-sustainable-management-of-coastal-fisheries-cabo-verde-cape-verde).

2. The [OBIS2030 project, which aims to provide a biodiversity data hub made of standardized, quality controlled and managed data to create information tailored to decision makers to help them protect and restore marine ecosystems and life in the ocean](https://www.obis.org/2023/04/19/obis2030-datahub/), has been endorsed by the UN Ocean Decade. OBIS2030 plans to identify and evaluate geographic and taxonomic data gaps, and to identify indicator species and ecosystems and strategies for species distribution modeling.

3. A [new Horizon Europe project, MARCO-BOLO (MARine COastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations)](https://www.obis.org/2023/04/19/marco-bolo-obis/) aims to improve the acquisition, coordination and delivery of marine, coastal and freshwater biodiversity observations to relevant users and to test new tools, technologies and models to better understand biodiversity decline.

**News and updates about applications**
1. The Allen Coral Atlas launched an [updated version of its coral bleaching monitoring system](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/advancements-in-coral-bleaching-monitoring/). Satellite data is used to monitor changes more accurately, by taking into account environmental changes and water signals (interference caused by the presence of water on satellite images or distortions in the signals received caused when water reflects light).

2. The [new cblindplot R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorBlindness/vignettes/colorBlindness.html) is designed to provide a collection of safe colours for plots, such as heatmaps, charts and maps, to [let colour blind people visualise spatial patterns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954123000742?via%3Dihub).

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [India's wild tiger numbers continue to grow](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/india-s-wild-tiger-numbers-continue-to-grow). Since 2010 the number of wild tigers more than doubled from 1411 to 3167 in 2022. Project Tiger was conceptualised with the goal to restore tiger populations and protect their habitats in India, and is now recognised as one of the most successful species-specific conservation programs worldwide.

2. Habitat loss, human population growth and conservation successes lead to humans and wild animals living in closer proximity and sharing the same scarce resources, with hundreds of humans and thousands of animals dying yearly due to human-wildlife conflicts yearly. At the [international conference on Human-Wildlife Conflict and Coexistence in Oxford, UK, the insights, solutions and required collaboration across disciplines and sectors to foster healthy and beneficial co-existence of people and wildlife were discussed and debated](https://cites.org/eng/node/136188). The focus now is on translating the commitments at the international level into concrete actions on the ground supported by sufficient funds to implement and sustain actions, including actions to address human wildlife conflict and promote coexistence. The next challenges will be to connect the funding sources and the areas where funds are the most needed.

**Climate**
1. [The future of water](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/future-forward-the-future-of-water/). To address the water crisis in East Java, Indonesia, local communities safeguard springs and clear rivers of rubbish. An Indigenous Minahasa youth from Wuwuk, Minahasa, Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia, made a [short film about the critical contributions that Indigenous peoples and local communities make](https://localbiodiversityoutlooks.net/film-rumamus-ong-gio-honouring-the-sacred-ancestral-ties-to-water/) as guardians of the land, and how they remember the ancestral history of their land and the water sources within it.

2. Record low rainfall pushed the Horn of Africa into a disastrous drought that is precipitating a humanitarian crisis. [Planetary forensics, such as measuring the amount of moisture in the soil, can be used to give a clear environmental signal about the conditions in dry regions](https://www.planet.com/pulse/using-planetary-forensics-to-visualize-historic-drought-in-the-horn-of-africa/). 

**Oceans**
1. An ambitious goal to mobilise [100 million USD to safeguard the ocean and sustainable seafood supplies](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/04/12/100-million-dollar-goal-to-scale-up-sustainable-fishing) to fund innovative research and supporting fisheries at all stages on the path to sustainability over the next decade has been unveiled by the MSC. 

2. [Antarctic summer sea ice minimum, the lowest ever observed](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/antarctic-summer-sea-ice-minimum-lowest-ever-observed). The sea ice coverage around Antarctica is now just 2.06 million km2, a new record after the previous unprecedented low of 2.17 million km2 observed in 2022. Sea ice decreases could add to the vulnerability of the adjacent ice shelves, making them less stable, and potentially contributing to the global sea level rise.

3. [Ocean Decade launches a new call for Decade Actions, focusing on marine pollution and marine ecosystem restoration and management](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-launches-new-cfda5-focusing-on-marine-pollution-and-marine-ecosystems/). There will be 2 online Q&A sessions on the Call for Decade Actions on the 4th and 5th of May. 

**Ecosystem services**
1. The journal [Forest is calling for contributions for a special issue focussed on innovative frameworks supporting decision-making processes through integrated ecosystem services assessments and sustainable finance principles](https://www.es-partnership.org/a-special-issue-of-forests/) by integrating research, techniques and tools that combine assessments on both ecosystem services and the impact of investments on ecosytems according to the environmental, social and governance criteria. The deadline for submissions is the 31st of October 2023.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [newly-funded Horizon Europe project B-Cubed](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101059592) will [transform biodiversity monitoring to ensure policymakers can proactively address the impacts of biodiversity change](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/984168). The overarching goal of the project is to make GBIF data ready-to-use for policy by providing GBIF data in data cubes, which are standardised, reproducible and citable. The project envisages a future where primary biodiversity data are seamlessly integrated into monitoring and forecasting such that policy and management can proactively respond to problems while at the same time reduce the costs of monitoring and management, and the negative impacts of biodiversity change.

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Open Data Management Platform (OpenDMP) has a new version (v1.6.1)](https://www.openaire.eu/opendmp-software-expands), containing new features that enable flexibility on certain DMP actions, new integrations with data services and updates of templates and language files.

2. The world's mangroves sequester more than 31 million tons of carbon in their soils and biomass each year, so the protection and restoration of these environments is critical for supporting biodiversity, combating climate change and helping communities to thrive. The [Blue Carbon Explorer is a Google Earth Engine app that provides detailed maps of mangroves and seagrasses](https://www.planet.com/pulse/the-nature-conservancy-and-planet-collaborate-to-map-blue-carbon/) to help governments evaluate the extent and health of these natural resources by integrating field-collected data from drone and satellite imagery to visualise and identify key areas for restoration and protecting, and prioritise management and conservation activities.

**Indices and indicators**
1. The [FAOSTAT Macro Indicators database provides macroeconomic indicators at the country and regional levels](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1637006/) relating to the total economy, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and manufacturing sub-industry, including statistics of 218 countries and territories, covering the period from 1970 to 2021.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [Galaxy project](https://galaxyproject.org/), an open-source platform for FAIR data analysis,  allows researchers to [analyse and share scientific data using various user-friendly web-based interfaces as well as interoperable application programming interfaces (APIs)](https://www.openaire.eu/welcoming-an-open-science-webspace-for-the-galaxy-community). 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Data sharing: what do we know and where can we go?](https://blog.datadryad.org/2023/04/12/dryad-in-the-community-data-sharing-what-do-we-know-and-where-can-we-go/), a webinar by OASPA about the different perspectives and policies of data sharing.

### Issue 7

Date: April 4th, 2023

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Exploring the vital role of our forests](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/exploring-the-vital-role-of-our-forests). Forests are key to combating climate change, purify water and air, prevent natural disasters (by reducing soil erosion, helping decrease the impact of storm surges and tsunamis and reducing the risk of wildfires), provide soil for agriculture and are home to a wealth of biodiversity (80% of amphibian species, 75% of bird species and 68% of mammal species, and 60% of all vascular plant species occur in tropical forests). 

**Climate**
1. [Leaders urged to heed science and act now to avert climate catastrophe](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/leaders-urged-to-heed-science-and-act-now-to-avert-climate-catastrophe). WWF scientists call on governments to accelerate action to phase out fossil fuels, slash emissions and restore nature.

2. [Marine ecosystems in a changing climate - Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf), a report published by the Ocean & Climate Platform. [Marine ecosystems are critical to climate mitigation and adaptation](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/), and are also increasingly vulnerable to climatic and human stressors, with some already reaching a tipping point. Transformational changes must be carried out to jointly and effectively deploy adaptation and mitigation responses at a large scale, as marine ecosystems provide so many benefits to the living world and are cornerstones of the transition to a more sustainable world.

3. [Climate group: without climate finance for states and regions there can be no net zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/without-climate-finance-for-states-and-regions-there-can-be-no-net-zero-warns-climate-group/). The Climate Group published a [new study](https://www.theclimategroup.org/media/20736/download) discussing mechanisms that state and regional governments can use to raise money to accelerate to net zero and adapt to climate change, and how subnational governments can effectively spend climate finance. As state and regional governments represent over 50% of all environment and climate spending, funding for climate action and policies at subnational level is essential to keep the world on track for 1.5°C of warming. 

4. Race to Zero has released its [Data Explorer](http://www.racetozerodataexplorer.org/), a new [tool, developed by Climate Arc, showcasing climate data from the largest (by revenue) 500 companies in the Race to Zero campaign](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-campaign-launches-new-tool-to-enhance-transparency-of-net-zero-commitments/). Nearly two thirds of the companies published a plan to get to net zero by 2050, and almost 80% published historical emissions data. The tool reveals the differences in quantity and quality of the [data published](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-data-explorer-faqs/), and finds that about 30% of companies are not reporting the full impact of their activities.

5. Although we are way off-target on the commitment to stabilize temperature rises to 1.5°C, there was also some good news in the report, as [the 1.5°C target is still viable](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/exponential-roadmap-initiative-and-now-for-the-good-news-from-the-ipcc-report-the-1-5c-target-is-still-viable/). All solutions are already here, are scalable, can be deployed rapidly, and are affordable. The [key to rapid change is to identify the feedback loops where behavioural change and political, economic and technological shifts create self-reinforcing cycles](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/comment-now-good-news-ipcc-report-15c-target-is-still-viable-2023-03-22/), driving ever-greater action and a green race to the top.

6. [Global, regional and country temperature change statistics from 1961 - 2022](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1635307/) show that [in 2022 the mean annual temperatures were warmer than normal in nearly 85% of all countries and territories for which statistics were available](https://www.fao.org/3/cc5064en/cc5064en.pdf). 


**Oceans**
1. The latest [Allen Coral Atlas impact report reveals the highlights from 2022](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/atlas-2022-impact-report/), including a dynamic [Turbidity dataset](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#turbidity), a new [Coral Reef Extent dataset](https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/nauru-coral-reef-data-allen-coral-atlas), [10 habitat mapping regions with custom improvements](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#habitatmaps) and [integrated Marine Protected Areas](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#mpas).

2. Collective action to create 'the ocean we want', by [officially endorsing 35 new Decade Actions](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-announces-wave-of-over-thirty-new-endorsed-actions/) that are collectively working in all ocean basins, strengthening the global momentum for ocean knowledge-based solutions.

3. The [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) [released its annual list of the top-ten remarkable new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/ten-remarkable-new-marine-species-from-2022/) (out of almost 1,700 marine species, including about 300 fossil species) described in 2022.

4. [Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://oceandecade.org/news/what-ocean-for-tomorrow-marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-change-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/): '[What ocean for tomorrow?](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf)' In the path to a sustainable future, it is crucial to make the protection of the ocean and its ecosystems a priority.

5. [Public and private sectors to advance ocean observing](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=448:public-and-private-sectors-to-advance-ocean-observing&catid=13&Itemid=125): "Today ocean observing activities  mostly rely on public funding, but this will not be sufficient to expand a sustained ocean observing system to meet the growing demands for ocean information." A collaboration between the public and private sectors can bring benefits to both sides across the whole ocean observing value chain. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Forest Watcher updates improve managing teams and reporting on data from the field](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/forest-watcher-mobile-app-updates/). Available data on recently detected tree cover loss and fires, combined with strong existing knowledge from the community, has made investigating potentially illegal clearings and fires within Buen Jardín de Callaru and many other communities across the tropics more efficient.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAire started a podcast](https://www.openaire.eu/let-s-talk-about-open-science) on exploring Open Science principles and practices in Europe, called [Open-ON-AIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/podcasts). In the first episode the human network powering the Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe is being discussed, and the second episode revolves around the OpenAIRE Graph and how it can be used to unlock the power of open science data and create new opportunities. Future episodes will explore a range of topics related to Open Science, their challenges and the sollutions to facilitate the transition towards more responsible and transparent scholarly communication. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The [OpenAIRE webinar on Horizon Europe Open Science requirements in practice](https://www.openaire.eu/unpacking-insights-answering-your-questions).

**Biodiversity**
1. [Understanding the dimensions of the Global Biodiversity Framework and our pathway to the 2030 targets and 2050 vision](https://geobon.org/understanding-the-dimensions-of-the-global-biodiversity-framework-and-our-pathway-to-the-2030-targets-and-2050-vision/). The post-2020 GBF is inarguably the most important piece of global biodiversity legislation in over a decade. A new [paper by Alice Hughes in Integrative Conservation discusses the process, strengths and weaknesses of the GBF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inc3.16).

**Climate**
1. [IPCC lead author Paulina Aldunce: 'What is everyone waiting for?'](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/ipcc-lead-author-paulina-aldunce-what-is-everyone-waiting-for/): The IPCC opened its 58th session to complete the last elements of its [Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/): the synthesis report and its summary for policymakers. The evidence and urgency scientists provide isn't reflected in decision-making.  

2. [Scientists deliver 'final warning' on climate crisis: act now or it's too late](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ipcc-climate-crisis-report-delivers-final-warning-on-15c). The comprehensive review of human knowledge of the climate crisis, the final part of its sixth assessment report, took eight years to compile, and delivers a clear message: act now, or it will be too late.

3. [Traditional air conditioners and refrigerants contain fluorinated gasses that can leak, deplete the ozone layer and harm the environment](https://eia-international.org/climate/sustainable-cooling-technologies/). Sustainable cooling targets efficiency improvements to cooling solutions alongside measures that lower ambient temperatures in buildings and urban environments. [2022 was the hottest year on record](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130237), and as the atmosphere warms, heatwaves, soaring temperatures, droughts and other weather extremes are becoming more frequent and more intense. [Sustainable cooling can help tackle the climate crisis](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-sustainable-cooling-and-how-can-it-help-tackle-the-climate-crisis/). 

4. [COP28 presidency launches bid called 'International Youth Climate Delegate Program' to put climate vulnerable youth at the center of climate talks](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/cop28-launches-program-to-put-marginalised-youth-at-the-centre-of-climate-talks/), stating: 'We may not know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future. It is you - our young people.' The objectives of the program include ensuring that youth views and proposals are fully integrated into global climate policymaking and dialogues; building youth skills, capacity, knowledge and networks, particularly in the most impacted countries, to engage in climate processes and providing a model for the COP process on youth inclusion. [People between 18 and 35, who demonstrate a commitment to climate issues and ideally have experience in the area, can apply to participate in the program until the 7th of April](https://www.cop28.com/en/youth-program).

**Oceans**
1. [Investor coalition to engage seafood sector on key nature risks](https://sustainablebrands.com/read/finance-investment/investor-coalition-engage-seafood-sector-key-nature-risks). New [WWF research](https://www.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Seafood-AM-Report.pdf) shows some banks and investors recognize the potential for environmental, social and governance risks in seafood but most lack robust or actionable policies, as fewer than 5% acknowledge having a process to identify the impacts of their financing activities on nature.

2. [The Global Fund for Coral Reefs](https://globalfundcoralreefs.org/) is a 10-year, $625 million coalition between UN agencies, financial institutions and private philanthropy sources, which supports [business models that can sustainably finance key conservation and development goals for coral reefs via two initiative funds](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/welcoming-the-global-fund-for-coral-reefs-to-the-race-to-resilience/); the grant fund, which provides technical assistance, capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, and the investment fund that generates de-risked investment capital to maximize the impact of projects incubated by the grant fund. 

3. [Why the High Seas Treaty is a breakthrough for the ocean and the planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/why-the-high-seas-treaty-is-a-breakthrough-for-the-ocean-and-the-planet/). The High Seas Treaty includes an agreement to impose strict protection of the ocean outside national borders and rules for the sustainable use of its resources, to ensure that we are not depleting ocean ecosystems and stipulates that environmental impact assessments must be completed before any new exploitation of marine resources in areas beyond national jurisdictions, and features provisions to allow for equitable sharing of knowledge, technologies and benefits from marine genetic resources. 

4. [Where is your squid coming from? Most likely unregulated waters, according to a new international study](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/where-squid-coming-likely-unregulated-waters-new-study/). Scientists and policymakers have voiced growing concerns about the decline of global squid stocks, but [little has been done to date to target squid fishing activities that are expanding into unregulated species](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8125). Using satellite imagery, vessel tracking and data monitoring, the study found that the fishing conducted by the globalized light-luring squid fishery was extensive, fishing between 149,000 and 151,000 vessel days annually, and that effort increased 68% over the study period from 2017 - 2020.

5. A [new Horizon EU project aims to identify the locations within the European seas where marine protected areas would protect the highest number of species, habitats and ecosystems](https://www.obis.org/2023/03/10/MPA_europe/). This information will support stakeholders involved in marine spatial planning in establishing effective conservation areas. 

**New platforms and initiatives**

1. GEO BON is developing an online platform, 'Bon in a Box' ([introduced with a short (3 minute) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLjnjCWwU3w)) that will help countries assess the information they have and guide monitoring to improve knowledge of the trends in biodiversity. There is a [one question questionnaire to assess interest of potential users and contributors](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexJu0obGMgMXZYyN4UNgw7LPTsrjhklogvk8YSgW2Mk5DoHg/viewform). 

2. The European Commission adopted the [Euratom Work Programme 2023 - 2025 ](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/57d8f069-9d63-4c55-a56d-53b4b9fad04b_en) implementing the [Euratom Research and Training Programme and supporting nuclear researchers with €132 million](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/researchers-receive-eu132-million-through-new-euratom-research-and-training-work-programme-2023-2025-2023-03-17_en) in funding. This [call for proposals will focus on the safety of Small Modular Reactors, development of nuclear materials and the secure management and disposal of radioactive waste](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,0;statusCodes=31094501;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=43298916;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState). 

3. [Planet's satellite data will be leveraged to enhance a unique monitoring solution for the defense and intelligence sector](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-and-preligens-partner-to-achieve-near-persistent-monitoring-for-defense-intelligence-analysts/), solving a critically needed data processing gap, accelerating the intelligence cycle and increasing overall situational awareness.

4. The [2023 UN Small Island Developing States Partnerships Awards are now accepting applications](https://sdgs.un.org/SIDSPartnershipsAwards) from all stakeholders. The deadline for applications is on the 28th of April, and the laureates of the Awards will be invited to New York in July 2023 at the Awards ceremony. 

5. The Joint Research Centre through he BIOPAMA program launched a [Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) focused on 'Assessing tourism services in protected areas: value chain and economic analyses'](https://mooc-conservation.org/courses/course-v1:mooc-conservation+01+2022/about), aiming to enable park managers, nature conservation agencies and other stakeholders to improve their capacity in assessing the tourism activities related to their protected areas and their economic and financial impacts. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Generative AI and the unceasing acceleration of academic writing](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/03/14/generative-ai-and-the-unceasing-acceleration-of-academic-writing/). The launch of ChatGPT has galvanized a debate around how it could or should be used in research and teaching. Mark Carrigan argues that the dynamic of ChatGPT and generative AIs as efficiency tools opens the door to further growth and acceleration in research outputs, but also raises questions about the value of these products of academic labour. For example, Science and Springer Nature have prohibited that ChatGPT was credited as a co-author on papers. Science's editor-in-chief argued that text produced by Chat-GPT would be seen as plagiarism whereas Nature has allowed their use under specific documented circumstances.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1.  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was opened for the world's governments for signature 50 years ago, on 3 March, 1973. Since then, its membership grew from 10 to 184 Parties, who [work together to ensure that animals and plants will not go extinct in the wild by regulating international wildlife trade, thereby guaranteeing that it is legal, sustainable and traceable](https://cites.org/eng/news/celebrating-50-years-of-cites). Roughly 3 months after the CoP19 in Panama City, [hundreds of species are accorded new regulatory measures](https://cites.org/eng/news/new-cites-trade-rules-come-into-effect). There are now [almost 40,000 species listed and therefore regulated under the Convention](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/celebrating-partnerships-for-conservation), ranging from elephants, crocodiles and tigers, to corals, caviar, orchids and high-value timbers. 10 Years ago on the 3rd of March, was the first World Wildlife Day, and this year on that date, the [legislation to create a U.S. Foundation for International Conservation, that would fund public-private partnerships designed to support large-scale conservation and effective protected area management around the world](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-statement-on-legislation-to-create-a-u-s-foundation-for-international-conservation) while also benefiting local communities, was reintroduced. 

2. To eliminate overfishing, illegality and habitat conversion from seafood value chains, a new collaboration of five conservation and biodiversity-focused organizations launched [an initiative that will leverage the power of investors to engage seafood companies on critical nature and biodiversity related impacts and risks](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-investor-collaboration-will-engage-the-seafood-sector-on-key-nature-risks-and-impacts).

3. To [safeguard tropical Africa's iconic species, let's preserve their close relationship with local communities](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2527). Over time, rainforest communities in Africa have developed a close relationship with umbrella species (iconic and/or threatened species, whose conservation also protects a wide range of flora and fauna that occur in the same habitat), such as great apes and elephants. This relationship is expressed in various cultural practices that are passed down from generation to generation. Several African governments are considering the inclusion of these practices and beliefs in the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage.

4. [Review reveals how biodiversity data supports research on human diseases](https://www.gbif.org/news/11OGVaJcueG829KraUfezA/review-reveals-how-biodiversity-data-supports-research-on-human-diseases), highlighting the possible benefits of better coordination on data sharing around global disease surveillance. 

**Climate**
1. To limit global warming, [ocean-based solutions have the potential to reduce the emissions-gap by up to 21%](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/gigawatt-dreams-to-reality-realizing-the-potential-of-offshore-wind-to-avert-a-climate-crisis/) by 2050: Coastal ecosystems can sequester large amounts of carbon, aquatic food production can provide low-carbon protein to the worlds' growing population, and offshore wind energy, which has the potential to provide more than enough energy to power the world four times over.

2. There is [no Paris Agreement without protecting, restoring, sustaining and managing nature, and this cannot be done without Indigenous Peoples, youth and finance](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/razan-al-mubarak-there-is-no-paris-agreement-without-protecting-restoring-sustaining-and-managing-nature/). 

**Oceans**
1. [Avoiding greenwashing and defining emission reductions: how a science-based framework could catalyse maritime's Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/avoiding-greenwashing-and-defining-emission-reductions/). More than 80% of global trade by volume is carried by sea, but only ~3% of global greenhouse gas emissions is contributed by this sector. In an interview with Jean-Marc Bonello the impact of a science-based framework on the Race to Zero is explained.

2. The [Copernicus Marine Service has implemented a significant upgrade to its main physical analysis and forecasting system](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/update-ocean-model-copernicus-marine). The improvements include better tracking of pollution, trade and marine navigation (better ship routing), polar environment monitoring (more accurate provision of sea ice conditions), better characterization of oceanic resources, better characterization of oceanic extremes and Marine Heat Waves.

3. [Schmidt Ocean Institute launches a new research vessel that will change the face of ocean exploration](https://oceandecade.org/news/soi-new-research-vessel-change-ocean-exploration/), bringing together breakthrough technology (including a 105 m2 main laboratory, a 150-ton crane, 2 moonpools, equipment for high-resolution ocean depth mapping) and the global marine science community. 

4. [Germany becomes the newest member of the Ocean Decade Alliance](https://oceandecade.org/news/germany-joins-the-ocean-decade-alliance/), bolstering its commitment to the UN Decade of Ocean for Sustainable Development. The Ocean Decade Alliance will support all forms of ocean science to successfully deliver the Ocean Decade's vision and thus contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

5. The world's leading art and design university, [the Royal College of Art, has been named a UN Ocean Decade Implementing Partner](https://oceandecade.org/news/royal-college-of-art-new-decade-implementing-partner/). The RCA will focus on tackling three of the challenges identified by the Ocean Decade: protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy, and change humanity's relationship with the ocean by generating measurable, sustainable and human-centred impact on the health of the ocean.  

6. A [key component of marine ecosystems, zooplankton, is changing together with our climate](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=447:a-key-component-of-marine-ecosystems-is-changing-together-with-our-climate&catid=13&Itemid=125). A new paper shows how various species are affected, and highlights that coordinated, sustained ocean observations will be essential to understand how ecosystems will continue to function in our changing environment.

7. [UN delegates reach history agreement on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134157): a text to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction has been finalized after nearly two decades of talks.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. 15 Small Grants Fund recipients, who are funded by the Global Forest Watch, across Central and South America, Africa and Southeast Asia are going to use [satellite-based forest monitoring technologies to raise awareness to build capacity to manage and protect forests and improve forest governance](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/2023-global-forest-watch-small-grants-fund-recipients/). Satellite imagery will be used to identify recent forest disturbances, which is crucial to stop deforestation.

2. [DataCite launches Global Access Program with support from CZI](https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-launches-global-access-program-with-support-from-czi/) (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), which is based on increasing community awareness, supporting and developing infrastructure and lowering financial barriers to access.  

3. A new method was developed to use [deep learning and natural language processing to extract mentions of risk factors of food insecurity from text](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/predicting-food-crisis-outbreaks-using-natural-language-processing-news-streams) of more than 11 million news articles about food-insecure countries published between 1980 and 2020. Almost 170 relevant keywords and phrases were discovered (such as 'drought', 'raising food prices' and 'pests'. Risk indicators of food insecurity were developed based on the occurrence of these keywords in news articles. A machine learning model has been developed that incorporates these news indicators to generate monthly district-level predictions. These predictions can be used to prioritize the allocation of emergency food assistance.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAIRE Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/) is an open resource that aggregates a collection of research data properties within the OpenAIRE Open Science infrastructure. The Graph is one of the largest and most heterogeneous collections of scholarly metadata for research products. A [roadmap with 5 future goals for the Graph was developed](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-graph-steadily-riding-the-wild-wave-of-open-science): 1) make the Graph well-developed and developer-friendly, 2) Make the Graph more interoperable, 3) Improve its coverage, 4) improve content quality and transparency and 5) make it easy to query and maintain.

2. The [results of the OpenAIRE survey 'Who is managing research data?](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-survey-who-is-managing-research-data), which has been filled out by 18 people. Based on the answers, proper research data management is being done by a wide variety of roles, often in an informal capacity. 

3. [Three reasons we should place a higher value on meta-research](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/02/23/three-reasons-we-should-place-a-higher-value-on-meta-research/) (investigating the process and norms of how knowledge is generated): it provides a high-level synthesis,  and is balanced and introspective.

[Three industry leaders explain what regenerative agriculture is](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-regenerative-agriculture-and-how-can-it-help-us-get-to-net-zero-food-systems-3-industry-leaders-explain/), and how it will help to get to net zero foodsystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [ENCORE biodiversity module](https://encore.naturalcapital.finance/en) is an extension of the ENCORE tool, a powerful database  enabling financial institutions to identify nature-related risks in their activities, helps [assess risks in the agricultural sector](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/spotlight-on-biodiversity-risk-in-the-agriculture-sector) by enabling financial institutions to assess to what extent their financial activities are potentially driving species extinction risk and ecological integrity risk. The module then provides guidance on the minimum level of biodiversity management practices required in order to be considered aligned with global biodiversity goals.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. A new paper '[Extending the CARE principles from tribal research policies to benefit sharing in genomic research](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/637acdc59cc1b65057118e99/1668992455706/fgene-13-1052620.pdf)' was published in Frontiers in Genetics.

**Online courses**
1. [Using spatial data for biodiversity](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/using-spatial-data-for-biodiversity/#learndash-course-content): a free 4-hour course, divided in 3 lessons, on the value of remote sensing for monitoring biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, using the UN Biodiversity Lab to visualize and analyze spatial data, and gain an understanding of how spatial data is used in conservation planning. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. [Insiders series: big cats and biodiversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyvriMaMPpE). In 2010, when the global wild tiger population was at an all-time low, 13 tiger-range countries worked together to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022. This webinar, by WWF's senior vice president for wildlife conservation Ginette Hemley as part of the WWF Conservation Insiders Series, addresses the lessons learned from these conservation efforts, and how the same model could be used to save other big cat species, such as jaguars, snow leopards and lions.

2. Copyright for Open Science Series Workshop 1: [The European context of copyright reform for Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dv_knKXiUM), outlining the current copyright initiatives and reforms that hold promise for expediting and incentivizing the move to open science.
