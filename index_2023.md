**Biodiversity**
1. [CITES Trade Database surpasses 25 million trade transaction records](https://cites.org/eng/news/cites_trade_database_surpasses_25_million_trade_transaction_records). More than 1.5 million records of trade in CITES-listed wildlife species are reported annually, with each record providing details about one permitted shipment transaction (import, export or re-export) of live or dead CITES-listed animals and plants and their parts and derivatives.

2. Scientists at the UNEP-WCMC have spearheaded new research identifying [32 global 'darkspots'](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-scientists-shed-light-on-plant-diversity-darkspots-for-major-new-report), where plant species are yet to be scientifically named, described and mapped. The research forms a central chapter in [Kew's latest State of the World's Plants and Fungi report](https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/State%20of%20the%20World%27s%20Plants%20and%20Fungi%202023.pdf), which focuses on what scientists do and don't know about the diversity of plants and fungi, and estimates that 77% of undescribed plants are threatened with extinction. A lack of data can lead to biassed or incorrect scientific conclusions, and many of the targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for nature rely on having robust biodiversity data.

3. After two close votes, the [EU Nature Restoration Law](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/nature-restoration-law_en) was passed this summer. The Nature Restoration Law [will commit EU member states to having recovery measures in place for 20% of the EU's land and sea by 2023](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/the-eus-nature-restoration-law-is-a-historic-opportunity-here-is-how-we-can-seize-this-moment), expanding to cover all degraded ecosystems by 2050. This is the first new EU law on nature in more than 20 years, and the first ever law dedicated solely to nature restoration in the world. If effectively implemented, it could catalyse the action needed to reverse centuries of biodiversity decline in Europe, where 81% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state.

4. [New research](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/study-reveals-huge-potential-for-increasing-transboundary-conservation-across-africa) has mapped existing and potential transboundary conservation areas (TBCAs). TBCAs are cross-border, cooperatively managed conservation areas, consisting of formally protected areas and other multiple-use areas, across Africa, revealing that there are at least 27 existing TBCAs in Africa, covering an area of 847,158 km2, as well as 8,481 potential TBCAs, which in total would cover nearly 2 million km2. The study, [Identifying opportunities for transboundary conservation in Africa](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2023.1237849/full) was published in Frontiers in Conservation Science.

5. A [new GBIF task group will address the urgent need for improved access to better data and information on invasive alien species in response to IPBES' Invasive alien species assessment](https://www.gbif.org/news/5z5ZYdbhG5CznrQjTZdKg7/gbif-ramps-up-support-of-information-needed-to-tackle-invasive-alien-species). IPBES concluded that support for information systems, infrastructures and data sharing was one of seven complementary strategic actions that could achieve ambitious progress in management, prevention and control of biological invasions. The task group will review recent developments in the science-policy interface relating to invasive alien species, and recommend actions for GBIF that will best address the needs of data users. These developments include not just the IPBES assessment, but also the needs of governments to track progress towards Target 6 of the KM-GBF, relating to preventing or reducing the introduction and establishment of invasive alien species.

6. [Recently a new book was published](https://www.es-partnership.org/book-on-nature-conservation-in-europe/): [Nature conservation in Europe](https://www.cambridge.org/co/universitypress/subjects/life-sciences/ecology-and-conservation/nature-conservation-europe-approaches-and-lessons?format=HB&isbn=9781108496742), edited by Graham Tucker, which provides a comprehensive overview of the status of Europe's nature, relevant threats and pressures, and it analyses the impact of human activities on ecosystems, giving a snapshot of international and EU biodiversity policies and legislative framework.

7. The Capabilities for Biodiversity and Sustainable Development (CEBioS) Programme, in cooperation with UNESCO, [published](https://www.es-partnership.org/new-unesco-manual-for-assessing-ecosystem-services-in-african-biosphere-reserves/) the [EVAMAB - Guidance for the Assessment of Ecosystem Services in African Biosphere Reserves](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000382278), addressing the evaluation of the economic value of ecosystem services in UNESCO-MAB sites, which will contribute to the transitioning to the green economy in Africa.

8. A UNESCO and IUCN [assessment](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385392) of the status of species [reveals](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2601) that UNESCO World Heritage sites harbour over 20% of mapped global species richness, including more than 75,000 species of plants and over 30,000 animal species, within just 1% of the Earth's surface. The World Heritage Convention enables coordinated initiatives with all relevant stakeholders, resulting in many success stories, such as the more than doubling of the population of Greater one-horned rhinos in the Kaziranga National Park (India) and Chitwan National Park (Nepal) since their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

9. [Bhutan announces a 'milestone achievement' with a 39.5% increase in snow leopard numbers](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/bhutan-announces-a-milestone-achievement-with-a-39-5-increase-in-snow-leopard-numbers), after the presence of 134 snow leopards has been confirmed, using 310 camera trap stations which covered more than 9,000 km2 of snow leopard habitat. Snow leopards are threatened by habitat degradation, prey depletion, conflict with humans, poaching and climate change, and the global population of snow leopards is declining. This survey however suggests that the conservation efforts in Bhutan to restore snow leopard habitat and combat poaching are having a positive impact. 

10. [A tale of resilience and restoration in Brazil's Para√≠ba do Sul River Basin](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/a-tale-of-resilience-and-restoration-in-brazils-paraiba-do-sul-river-basin/): a region that is home to some of the country's largest industrial and population centres, where water resources are the lifeline for over 14 million people, playing a crucial role in supplying water, generating electricity, diluting effluents, and serving various other purposes. However, after extensive deforestation, particularly during the 18th and 19th-century coffee cycle, a significant portion of its territories were left degredad and unproductive. The government set an ambitious goal at COP26: to increase the forest coverage of the Atlantic Forest from 30% to 40% by 2050, translating to the restoration of an additional 440,000 hectares, with the potential to absorb 159 million tons of carbon dioxide. The main beneficiaries of this project are rural landowners with limited financial capacity, as it will enhance their resilience and wellbeing, foster sustainable agricultural practices and contribute to the overall development of the region. 

11. [The "three horsemen" of climate-linked biodiversity loss: why improving ocean observing is crucial for life below water](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=465:the-three-horsemen-of-climate-linked-biodiversity-loss-why-improving-ocean-observing-is-crucial-for-life-below-water&catid=13&Itemid=125). Record-breaking ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic resulted in several intense marine heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere last summer. When the ocean is becoming warmer, more acidic and less oxygenated, how can we monitor and protect the marine biodiversity we depend upon? Rising temperatures, acidification and deoxygenation are directly or indirectly driven by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and their absorption into the ocean. All three are also the major climate-driven stressors affecting marine biodiversity on a global scale. For example, warming temperatures are known to be the main cause of coral bleaching events in tropical waters. Ocean acidification reduces the corals' abilities to build calcium carbonate skeletons and grow, and deoxygenation is detrimental to reef organisms that rely on oxygen. But the effect of the stressors extend far beyond tropical coral reefs, and also affects commercially valued species such as oysters and crabs.

12. The Global Ocean Observing System has just [published](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=467:status-of-the-global-ocean-observing-system-in-2023&catid=13&Itemid=125) its [latest annual report](https://www.ocean-ops.org/reportcard2023/reportcard2023.pdf) on the status of the observing system and how its  ocean observing networks meet urgent societal needs, and focuses on several key areas, including: delivering a global overview of the status of the ocean observing networks; tracking marine heatwaves; streamlining the connection between observations and services to improve extreme event forecasts; monitoring the health of our seagrass habitats; and collaborating with industry.

**Climate**
1. An [assessment of water-related climate change adaptation initiatives in Thailand](https://www.thai-german-cooperation.info/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lessons-from-piloting-ME-of-EbA-in-THs-water-sector.pdf) has found that [living weirs and re-establishing floodplains can reduce the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/lessons-for-ecosystem-based-adaptation-along-thailands-changing-rivers), alongside a range of other benefits, such as increased soil moisture and recharged groundwater, and mitigating the risk of flooding during heavy rainfall. Thailand is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and was one of the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather, such as floods and droughts, globally between 2000 and 2019.

2. A [groundbreaking report](https://sdgs.un.org/synergy-solutions-world-crisis-tackling-climate-and-sdg-action-together) by a group of independent experts [released](https://sdgs.un.org/news/governments-must-seek-win-win-synergies-tackling-climate-and-sustainable-development-crises) by the United Nations outlines steps governments should take to maximise the impact of policies and actions by tackling the climate and sustainable development crises at the same time, creating synergies. According to the report, the factors blocking more synergistic actions revolve around knowledge gaps, political and institutional arrangements, and economic disruptions. The report recommends that policymakers have stronger links with researchers studying climate and development, who could assess possible synergies.

3. [A climate insurance success story: The Medell√≠n Project](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/improving-urban-resilience-through-insurance-innovations-in-colombia/). To combat the threats of floods and landslides in Medell√≠n, the Medell√≠n Project, with at its core the mission to bolster Medell√≠n's financial resilience against climate-related risks and natural disasters. Technical expertise was developed, knowledge shared and local barriers navigated, and this project acted as the bridge connecting the insurance sector and the community's needs, ultimately empowering the city to manage its own risk. 

4. [The false dilemma between economy and planet](https://sdg-action.org/the-false-dilemma-between-economy-and-planet/). There is a growing chorus calling for delays to net-zero initiatives, blaming climate action for the current cost of living crisis. In reality, green investment can offer a path out of the economic troubles that have been building since the start of the century. Despite the multifaceted adverse impact of the surge in energy prices since 2021, the crisis could offer an opportunity to accelerate the switch to clean energy and align with the green transition and the Sustainable Development Goals. 

5. Nature-based solutions are increasingly hailed as a way to boost cities' climate resilience, biodiversity and social cohesion. But [what does it mean to be well adapted to climate change and how will we be able to recognise it in our cities?](https://sdg-action.org/are-nature-based-solutions-really-helping-us-to-adapt-to-climate-change-in-cities/) Not having clear definitions and goals makes it impossible to know if we are going in the right direction. The different indicators used to evaluate progress on adaptation tell different stories about how we imagine what it means to adapt to climate change. 

6. New data from the World Resources Institute's [Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas](https://www.wri.org/insights/highest-water-stressed-countries) show that 25 countries, housing 25% of the global population, face extremely high water stress each year (where up to 80% of the entire water supply is being used up), and at least 50% of the world's population live under highly water-stressed conditions for at least one month per year. Since 1960, the demand for water has doubled, due to growing populations and industries, livestock, energy producing and manufacturing, and is exceeding what's available, due to a lack of investment in water infrastructure, unsustainable water use policies and increased variability due to climate change. 

7. [The latest data confirms: forest fires are getting worse.](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/fires/data-trends-forest-fires-getting-worse/) They are becoming more widespread and burn nearly twice as much tree cover than 20 years ago. Calculations show that forest fires now result in 3 million more hectares of tree cover loss per year. In 2023 there was already heightened fire activity, such as the record-breaking burns across Canada and the fires in Hawaii. Climate change is one of the major drivers of increasing fire activity. Extreme heat waves are already 5 times more likely today than they were 150 years ago and are expected to become even more frequent. Hotter temperatures help create the perfect conditions for larger, more frequent forest fires, which in turn leads to higher emissions, further exacerbating climate change, contributing to more fires: the [fire-climate feedback loop](https://www.wri.org/insights/6-graphics-explain-climate-feedback-loop-fueling-us-fires). Improving forest resilience by ending deforestation and forest degradation is key to preventing future fires, as is limiting nearby burning that can easily escape into forests.

8. GEO is on a mission to empower cities globally to tackle the health challenges brought on by extreme heat, and therefore share the [Global Heat Impacts and Solutions Survey](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/fefbffc42eaa4cb79094d9053a5dc2c4), which should take not more than 5 minutes to complete. Everyone is invited to participate, and the deadline is Friday the 17th of November.

9. [Water crisis threatens $58 trillion, equivalent to 60% of global GDP, in economic value, food security and sustainability](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/water-crisis-threatens-58-trillion-in-economic-value-food-security-and-sustainability). A new report, published by WWF, [The high cost of cheap water](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwwfint.awsassets.panda.org%2Fdownloads%2Fwwf-high-cost-of-cheap-water--final-lr-for-web-.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CAmy.Fallah%40wwfus.org%7C9b82fb5479a840b4bfef08dbcb18fb98%7Cdb6aaa89c7f8485186769cc7f73b3411%7C0%7C0%7C638327083965004889%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=l8IfZXd4rXvLre7yQMH6SrFImIO2xSq%2BfkS0ScbZJGk%3D&reserved=0), uncovers not only the financial costs, but also that the world's freshwater ecosystems are in a downward spiral: since 1970 the world has lost 1/3 of its remaining wetlands, and freshwater wildlife populations have on average dropped by 83%. 

**Oceans**
1. [Vision 2030: working group 1 takes collaborative effort to assess and mitigate effort to assess and mitigate marine pollution through a comprehensive roadmap](https://oceandecade.org/news/vision-2030-wg1-takes-collaborative-effort-to-assess-and-mitigate-marine-pollution/). A dedicated expert Working Group has been established to identify the priorities for the Ocean Decade in relation to marine pollution. The members of the working group will write a report outlining the current state of the pollution challenge, identify knowledge gaps as well as capacity building, infrastructure and resource mobilisation needs, and propose actionable steps as part of the Ocean Decade to better understand the life cycle of pollutants, their long-term impacts, and the effectiveness of regulatory measures and strategies aimed at their minimization and mitigation.

2. The OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic published recently an [assessment](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/quality-status-reports/qsr-2023/) of the health of the North-East Atlantic. The [report shows](https://oceandecade.org/news/loss-of-biodiversity-pollution-and-climate-change-continue-to-affect-the-north-east-atlantic/) declining biodiversity and continued habitat degradation, an ever-more pressing need to address drivers of degradation and biodiversity loss, climate change and ocean acidification are driving major changes affecting much of the marine biodiversity, and that environmental quality did improve in some aspects (releases of PCBs, PAHs and organochlorines have decreased substantially, pollution by radioactive substances has been prevented, discharges by the oil and gas industry have been reduced and marine litter is better tracked).

3. The first publication of the [Challenger 150 Programme](https://challenger150.world/), a chapter in the new Oceanography and Marine Biology book '[Review of the Central and South Atlantic shelf and deep-sea benthos: science, policy, and management](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.1201/9781003363873-5/review-central-south-atlantic-shelf-deep-sea-benthos-science-policy-management-amelia-bridges-kerry-howell-teresa-amaro-lara-atkinson-david-barnes-narissa-bax-james-bell-angelo-bernardino-lydia-beuck-andreia-braga-henriques-angelika-brandt-mar%C3%ADa-bravo-saskia-brix-stanley-butt-alvar-carranza-brenda-doti-isa-elegbede-patricia-esquete-andr%C3%A9-freiwald-sylvie-gaudron-maila-guilhon-dierk-hebbeln-tammy-horton-paulus-kainge-stefanie-kaiser-daniel-lauretta-pablo-limongi-kirsty-mcquaid-rosanna-milligan-patricia-miloslavich-bhavani-narayanaswamy-covadonga-orejas-sarah-paulus-tabitha-pearman-jose-angel-perez-rebecca-ross-hanieh-saeedi-mauricio-shimabukuro-kerry-sink-angela-stevenson-michelle-taylor-j%C3%BCrgen-titschack-rui-vieira-beatriz-vinha-claudia-wienberg), represents the most comprehensive summary of some of the world's least explored ocean space.

4. [Canada and the UK announced their commitment to support the Joint Analytical Cell](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/canada-and-the-uk-commit-support-to-the-joint-analytical-cell-to-combat-illegal-fishing/), a collaborative initiative which provides authorities with the intelligence, analysis, and capacity building needed to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities.

5. The Ocean Biodiversity Information System is the most comprehensive gateway to the world's ocean biodiversity and biogeographic data and information. OBIS offers a free course '[Contributing and publishing datasets to OBIS](https://oceanexpert.org/event/3983), which started on the 2nd of October and will run until the 16th of February, 2024. It is a self-paced course, consisting of 8 modules, starting with an introduction to data standards like Darwin Core, and ending with modules on how to check the data quality of a dataset and how to publish and access data within OBIS, and takes approximately 32 hours to complete.

6. [Businesses and fisheries involved in the MSC Program for sustainable fishing are helping deliver 34 of key United Nations targets](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/09/13/extra-impetus-needed-to-meet-global-development-ocean-targets) of respectively 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty and address urgent challenges for environmental, social and economic development. 

7. A [new review will ensure the MSC Chain of Custody Standard is up to date and reflects changes in industry best practice](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/09/13/msc-launches-new-review-of-chain-of-custody-standard). The last review was in 2019, and since then there have been significant changes in global supply chains that need to be reflected in the Standard requirements; such as the evolution of best practice and legislation in product and supply chain integrity, as well as rapid advances in digital technology and the learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused a significant disruption to supply chains worldwide. Currently, over 20,000 products are sold with the MSC ecolabel, which are available in 66 countries. 

8. After governments failed to prevent overfishing of Atlanto-Scandian herring, one of Europe's most iconic and economically important fish stocks, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the science organisation responsible for advising governmetns on sustainable catch limits, has [advised a steep cut of 44% in AS herring catches][(https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/09/29/atlanto-scandian-herring-stock-driven-to-critical-levels-as-catches-face-steep-cut-by-44)], equivalent to 302,932 metric tonnes. But even when adhering to that figure, herring stocks could still fall even lower by 2025, breaching a critical level and ristking the long-term sustainability of the stock. 

9. [Launch of the Ocean Breakthroughs: 5 pathways to catalyse action to achieve a healthy and productive ocean](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/launch-of-the-ocean-breakthroughs/) where accelerated action and investments could deliver up to 35% GHG emissions reduction and contribute to a resilient, nature-positive and net zero future by 2050. The key ocean sectors: marine conservation, ocean renewable energy, shipping, aquatic food and coastal tourism. Accelerated action and investments in each will help unlock the potential of the ocean as a source of solutions to the pressing challenges posed by climate change and biodiversity loss.

10. [How much coral reef is out there to save?](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/coral-reef-area-to-save/) The Allen Coral Atlas determined that there is 423,589 km2 of global reef cover. The Allen Coral Atlas uses satellite imagery remote sensing techniques to estimate and monitor coral reefs around the world accurately.

11. Global ocean exploration nonprofit [OceanX has signed a historic letter of cooperation with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO](https://oceandecade.org/news/oceanx-partners-with-the-intergovernmental-oceanographic-commission-of-unesco-to-implement-ocean-decade-goals/) (IOC/UNESCO) in a monumental effort to support and encourage the implementation of the United Nations Ocean Decade. The agreement establishes a collaboration on a variety of projects, including international communication and outreach, making OceanX expedition data accessible to the public and sponsoring joint initiatives. 

12. [Fisheries intelligence report reveals vessel behaviours associated with spoofing activity](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/fisheries-intelligence-report-reveals-vessel-behaviors-associated-with-spoofing-activity/). The Joint Analytical Cell [published a new collaborative analysis](https://imcsnet.org/resource/jac-intel-report-010-150-vessels-overview-analysis) examining a fleet of Chinese-linked distant-water squid fishing vessels displaying behaviour that indicates efforts to hide fishing activity, including possible illegal, unreported and unregulated activity. The vessels identified by the JAC have engaged in regular name changes over the Automatic Identification System, sharing names and Maritime Mobile Service Identifiers and other spoofing behaviour from individual vessels, making it difficult to monitor individual vessels, confirm their identities and associate them with a flag State.


**New platforms and initiatives**
1. In July 2023, the [CoastPredict programme officially launched its experiment 'GlobalCoast'](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/inside-globalcoast-the-global-coastal-ocean-experiment/), with the establishment of pilot sites across up to 20 diversity regions of the global coastal ocean. By completing the [GlobalCoast survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7T3HSPN?fbclid=IwAR3-Uu5FWbxOl9BE9Vp3LOSn5uJvioN18tKpPsaFAWLGfR5_lY2DjD8N884), everyone can propose a GlobalCoast pilot site. The survey will be used to identify existing coastal gaps in stressors and vulnerabilities, assessing available work, infrastructure, and data from various initiatives and integrating regionally relevant activities and aspirations for coastal resilience within the UN Ocean Decade community.

2. [Seavoice](https://www.seavoice.online/), an innovative magazine delving deep into the intricate relationship between culture, climate, and water [sheds light on the intersection between nature and culture](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/seavoice-magazine/) inspiring collective responsibility for the oceans. Its first volume, 'Osmosis', is out now.

3. [UNEP-WCMC welcomes the launch of the TNFD disclosure framework and urges global engagement](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-welcomes-launch-of-tnfd-disclosure-framework-and-urges-global-engagement). The [disclosure framework](https://tnfd.global/final-tnfd-recommendations-on-nature-related-issues-published-andcorporates-and-financial-institutions-begin-adopting/) of the [Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures](https://tnfd.global/) sets out a detailed process to help private sector and finance organisations review and report on nature-related risks and opportunities and integrate findings into business and financial planning. It is not mandatory for organisations to report or use the TNFD recommendations, but it is expected that the framework will be integrated into country disclosure requirements in due course.

4. [Conservation organisations unite to overcome barriers to ecosystem restoration in Europe](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/conservation-organisations-unite-to-overcome-barriers-to-ecosystem-restoration-in-europe). The project aims to generate collective solutions to restore ecosystems across Europe, and its solutions could help address global barriers to restoration and support the [UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/). Restoration can help address biodiversity loss, land degradation and climate change while supporting ecosystem services and improving overall human well-being.

5. [UNEP-WCMC welcomes launch of Global Biodiversity Framework fund, but calls for greater ambition to deliver finance for nature](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-welcomes-launch-of-global-biodiversity-framework-fund-but-calls-for-greater-ambition-to-deliver-finance-for-nature). The fund will play an essential role in helping distribute the vital resourcing needed to meet the targets and goals of the KM-GBF, with the framework itself stipulating major financing for nature from all sectors.

6. [Global Fishing Watch welcomed a new partnership with Palau](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-and-palau-enter-partnership-to-enhance-transparency-in-fisheries-sector/) that aims to strengthen sustainable fisheries management and promote transparency as a principle of ocean governance. Under this partnership, GFW will provide analytical support based on the examination of vessel behaviours, fleet patterns and trends associated with port inspections, licensing and enforcement efforts, which can help inform the country's ongoing development of its national fisheries policy and marine spatial plans, and also strengthen its regional and international influence in support of ocean governance initiatives. 

7. [Guide to publishing camera trap data opens for community peer review](https://www.gbif.org/news/1tNrbZGtOLUw2rdUKsM8Se/guide-to-publishing-camera-trap-data-opens-for-community-peer-review), until Tuesday the 31st of October 2023. The proliferation of data from sensors of camera traps has made data management, rather than data collection, the limiting factor in camera trap-related research. This guide therefore provides up-to-date guidelines that optimise data management and publication by anyone running a camera trap study. 

8. [Can AI help with the heavy lifting of research communications?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/21/can-ai-help-with-the-heavy-lifting-of-research-communications/): a blog by Andy Tattersall. Tools like ChatGPT have real potential for the dissemination of research as a starting point for creating lay summaries, as well as saving time. But it is not without its problems, such as the common issue of AI hallucinations, for example the addition of fictional quotes or references. Key to leveraging AI tools is learning how to write effective prompts.  

9. The International Coral Reef Initiative, a network including 45 countries who represent over 75% of the world's coral reefs, has [launched](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/coral-reef-breakthrough-launches/) the [Coral Reef Breakthrough](https://coralbreakthrough.org/) in partnership with the Global Fund for Coral Reefs and the UN Climate Change High-level Climate Champions. The Coral Reef Breakthrough aims to secure the future of at least 125,000 km2 of shallow-water tropical coral reefs with investments of at least US$12 billion to support the resilience of more than half a billion people globally by 2030. There are 4 action points to achieve the Coral Reef Breakthrough: 1. stop drivers of loss, including land-based sources of pollution, destructive coastal development and overfishing; 2. double the area of coral reefs under effective protection, 3. accelerate reforestation by assisting the development and implementation of innovative solutions at scale and climate smart designs that support coral adaptation to impact 30% of degraded reefs by 2030, and 4. secure investments of at least US$12 billion by 2030 from public and private sources. 

10. The Greater Mara Ecosystem in Kenya is world famous for its wildlife, and is home to an estimated 2,600 elephants. Since 2001, the natural forests where the elephants live have shrunk by 60% due to illegal logging and encroachment. The Mara Elephant Project is a local organisation protecting wildlife, communities and habitats in the Maasai Mara. Due to the vast size (over 300,000 ha) and impenetrable thickness of these forests, monitoring for deforestation and loss can be a challenge. To facilitate monitoring, [Global Forest Watch has partnered with EarthRanger](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/protecting-forest-habitats-mara-elephant-project/), a software that collects, integrates and displays remote sensing data along with tracking and field reports into one unified platform, to provide satellite data, including deforestation and fire alerts. Since the partnership, there has been an increase in arrests and seizures related to habitat destruction.  

11. [Addressing consumer water use: the next phase of corporate sustainability](https://www.wri.org/insights/corporate-downstream-targets-consumer-water-use). Companies setting water targets to reduce water use and improve water quality within their own facilities is a growing trend in corporate sustainability. But these operational and 'upstream' water targets only address water risks and impacts in the production stage of the value chain. But for example soap, shampoo, toothpaste, laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid and other consumer goods products require even more water when consumers use them, so called 'downstream' water, then when they are being manufactured. Businesses must be adaptive and forward-thinking, and help create a more water-secure future by accounting for the full lifecycle of water use.

**News and updates about applications**
1. [eCITES: Transforming global wildlife trade management](https://cites.org/eng/news/sg-statements/eCITES-transforming-global-wildlife-trade-management). CITES mandates that specimens of species listed in the CITES Appendices must have official trade documentation such as permits and certificates. To overcome problems associated with paperwork, and to avoid complications, false information, and even theft, the permit application and issuance, control of trade, reporting of statistics and exchanges of permit information can now all be done online, in the new permit system [eCITES](https://cites.org/eng/prog/eCITES). 

2. [Personalised static maps with markers and labels with MapTiler Server](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2023/10/personalized-static-maps-with-server-4-4/). New improvements also end the cropped labels at tile margins, by altering the margins to incorporate the longest labels on the map, and allow for flexible floating licences for Docker and Virtual Machines. Therefore, it is possible to share MapTiler Server licences from a central pool, allowing multiple people to use the software simultaneously.


**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network will hold a two-day summit titled [Building Action and Power](https://usindigenousdatanetwork.wordpress.com/us-indigenous-data-sovereignty-governance-summit/) on 11 - 12 April 2024, near Tucson, Arizona, on the homelands of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. The [goals of the meeting](https://nni.arizona.edu/news/building-action-and-power-us-indigenous-data-sovereignty-network-announces-dates-first-idsov) are to 1. establish a national standard in the US for Indigenous data governance, 2. create an Indigenous data standard via nation-to-nation partnerships between Indigenous Peoples and the federal government and 3. enhance Indigenous Peoples laws, policies, and systems for Indigenous data sovereignty led by the priorities, vision, and strengths of sovereign Indigenous Peoples for our shared data futures.

2. [Making retraction data freely accessible - why Crossref's acquisition of the Retraction Watch database is a big step forward](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/09/27/making-retraction-data-freely-accessible-why-crossrefs-acquisition-of-the-retraction-watch-database-is-a-big-step-forward/). The Retraction Watch Database contains about 43,000 retractions, and the API of Crossref sees over 1.1 billion queries each month. The more comprehensive and accurate the metadata, the more value it provides to its users, and Crossref encouraged the registration of retraction information by the users. However, information on retractives registered by users has not been comprehensive, highlighting the value of the collaboration with Retraction Watch.

3. [The benefits of Open Science are not inevitable: monitoring its development should be value-led](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/). Open Science is increasingly becoming a policy focus and paradigm for all scientific research, but attempts to monitor the transition to Open Science should be informed by the values underpinning this change, rather than discrete indicators of Open Science practices. 

4. [Insufficient README files are the top reason for publication delays on Dryad](https://blog.datadryad.org/2023/10/18/for-authors-creating-a-readme-for-rapid-data-publication/#). Some [tips for the development of README files](https://youtu.be/A5HqsamqpTo), which do not only apply to Dryad, but for example also to GitHub, are the use of Markdown (.md), using headings, line breaks and bullet points and avoiding long paragraphs, including clear instructions on accessing and using the data, list all sources where the data was derived from, and describe all scripts, code, notebooks and software used. 

5. The Global Indigenous Data Alliance published the [Indigenous data governance & universities communiqu√©](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6532e9f2c6408833cb36097d/1697835506775/GIDA+Communique+FINAL.pdf), which was developed at the GIDA Indigenous Data Sovereignty Summit in June this year, in Naarm, Australia. It highlights points on which universities must work, such as recognising that any data concerning Indigenous Peoples is Indigenous data, to support and grow Indigenous leadership to assess digital research infrastructure needs, and that data management strategies and plans with specific Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Indigenous Data Governance principles and mechanisms should be operationalised. Furthermore it shows a list of resources which can be helpful in the process, such as the CARE Principles, Indigenous Peoples' Rights in Data, Indigenous Metadata Bundle and the First Nations Information Governance Committee. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. To celebrate the [International Day of World's Indigenous Peoples](https://www.un.org/en/observances/indigenous-day) on the 9th of August, the BES-Net consortium of UNESCO, UNDP and UNEP-WCMC talked to Indigenous youth from Colombia, Kenya, Thailand, Fiji and Norway on [this year's theme 'Indigenous youth as agents of change for self-determination' in relation to pressing challenges of biodiversity loss](https://www.besnet.world/international-day-of-the-worlds-indigenous-peoples/).

2. A [high-level scoping study](https://tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/23-24755-Global-Data-Facility-Paper_V14.pdf) undertaken by the [Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures](https://tnfd.global/) and 11 partner organisations including GBIF has concluded that [high-quality nature-related data is a global public good with increasing demand from a wide array of public, private and civil society stakeholders everywhere](https://www.gbif.org/news/5YXFGAx3syqIZ2ljoJDikb/scoping-study-explores-a-global-nature-related-public-data-facility). Since the agreement on the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework the interest in global-scale solutions to nature-related data needs has accelerated, as the availability of accurate, comparable and policy-relevant data is an essential prerequisite to help organisations become more resilient in the face of nature-related risks and to facilitate the flow of capital to nature positive outcomes.

3. [Morpho welcomes three interdisciplinary projects in ecological science that merge managers and scientists by announcing the second cohort of synthesis projects](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/morpho-welcomes-second-cohort) on locating the best locations to protect and restore kelp forests while minimizing personal conflicts and maximizing local benefits, detangling the complexities of plant-insect interactions and identifying species that maximally support an ecosystem and developing more sustainable practices for fuel breaks to prevent fire from speading and providing improved access and evacuation routes for firefighters. These synthesis groups will transform over time to meet the needs of society and decision makers for data-driven environmental solutions.

4. The [Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants Programme](https://citesmike.org/) of CITES facilitated a [comprehensive training on site monitoring in Kenya](https://cites.org/eng/news/supporting-rangers-and-strengthening-elephant-conservation-efforts-in-Kenya-CITES-MIKE-Programme-conducts-site-monitoring-training). The primary focus was on enhancing the skills of law enforcement officers, conservation partners and KWS database managers on elephant mortality data collection, such as knowledge on the various data to be collected when encountering an elephant carcass as well as the appropriate methodologies for data collection. Comprehensive data is vital for understanding the threats facing elephant populations in specific sites facilitating the development of conservation strategies.

5. A new [report](https://eklipse.eu/wp-content/uploads/website_db/Request/Mitigation_hierarchy/EKLIPSE_Report-01-23-Report_final.pdf) from the Eklipse Mitigation Hierachy Working Group was recently published, compiling the extensive analytical work of three years in the make. The report [aims to provide an overview of the state of knowledge regarding how we can improve adherence to the Mitigation Hierarchy](https://www.es-partnership.org/new-report-of-the-biodiversity-impact-mitigation-hierarchy-with-the-contribution-of-our-expert/) (how biodiversity impacts can first be avoided, then mitigated and compensated), with a particular focus on the avoid state especially in projects impacting nature.

6. A group of [researchers in Europe and Latin America is conducting research on pathways towards lower deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon forest](https://www.es-partnership.org/request-to-participate-in-survey-on-deforestation-in-brazilian-amazon/). They developed a [survey](https://survey.uu.nl/jfe/form/SV_a3OL5nbpTd2EJ8y) (about 5 minutes to complete) and invite all Ecosystem Services Partnership members to participate. 

7. [Bhutan's wild tiger population increases 27% to 131 individuals from first systematic survey in 2015](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/bhutan-s-wild-tiger-population-increases-27-from-first-systematic-survey-in-2015). This conservation success is a result of increased law enforcement, community-based tiger conservation programs and habitat improvement. From 22 - 24 April 2024, Bhutan will host a conference on sustainable finance for tiger landscapes in collaboration with a coalition of major tiger conservation NGOs and IGOs in Thimphu, as part of [the ambition to support Tiger Range Countries in realising long-term tiger conservation](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-and-partners-announce-coalition-to-raise-finance-for-tiger-conservation/). IUCN's Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme supported the Tiger Range Countries to strengthen supportive policy and sustain conservation impacts by helping to protect tigers, preserve habitats and support people living in and around tiger habitats. 

8. [Despite the progress during the Amazon Summit, WWF expresses great concern at the lack of a common goal to end deforestation in the region](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/despite-the-progress-during-the-amazon-summit-wwf-expresses-great-concern-at-the-lack-of-a-common-goal-to-end-deforestation-in-the-region).

**Climate**
1. Multiple temperature records were broken in recent weeks, with extreme heatwaves in the Southwest United States, Mexico, Southern Europe and China. Around the world, [hot days and extreme weather events are becoming more intense and more frequent](https://www.earthobservations.org/geo_blog_obs.php?id=597). The [Group on Earth Observations (GEO) organised a roundtable discussion 'Building the foundation for hear resilient communities'](https://www.earthobservations.org/geo_blog_obs.php?id=599) on the 31st of July. Over 40 participants, including policymakers, geospatial information managment experts, statisticians, development organisations, researchers and practitioners, joined the roundtable, at which the initials plans to develop a Global Heat Resilience Service with a goal of providing every urban area in the world with intelligence on the health risks from exposure to extreme heath.

2. Indigenous Peoples are affected by poverty and climate change to a higher degree than other people, possibly due to biodiversity decline on Indigenous lands as a result of the world's industrialisation and overcompensation. The [solution lies in ensuring that Indigenous Peoples remain connected to their ancestral land and knowledge, and that they play a key role in developing climate change policy](https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/300915317/indigenous-knowledge-as-a-foundation-for-sustainable-trade-partnerships?fbclid=IwAR39-MGdhqm3pK-ttd0BgssC3zP5-0enADuoW-IszEaXdKpszwCDpCufNB0_aem_AV1pp5lhU5Txz2q25qeVOLSR8fO0g_z8yzGEiGOPmuWmE_CfmUaNK3XGI_C0_QMmhCU). In New Zealand, the MƒÅori must exercise real influence over trade policy at all stages of decision-making. To understand the wider benefits to the economy, climate and international trade, the differences between European and Indigenous approaches to trade must be understood. An Indigenous perspective to trade is a relational exchagne of culture, resulting in a unity between people, knowledge and nature, encouraging intergenerational equity, and economic, social and environmental value for all. The [Local Biodiversity Outlooks illustrates the vital contributions of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities with an interactive map of case studies](https://localbiodiversityoutlooks.net/case-studies/interactive-map/).  

3. The goal of achieving responsible and equitable water usage is more pressing than ever, as [water scarcity has become a global concern](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/fair-water-footprints-a-pivotal-event-at-world-water-week-2023/?_gl=1*bsqavc*_ga*Njc4MzQ2MjA3LjE2NzAyNTIxMDE.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTY5MTc3MzUzOS41LjEuMTY5MTc3Mzk3My4wLjAuMA..). Half of global water use from rivers and aquifers to supply the food and goods consumed by high-income economies originates from unsustainable sources, including regions facing severe water scarcity. During the World Water Week 2023, the free online session of ['Fair water footprints: changing the game in the Race to 2030'](https://worldwaterweek.org/tickets) on the 22nd of August from 9:30 - 10:00 CET is scheduled.

**Oceans**
1. [An inside look at the beauty and benefits of mangroves](https://oceandecade.org/news/an-inside-look-at-the-beauty-and-benefits-of-mangroves/). Mangroves are among the most misunderstood ecosystems, sometimes being perceived as dirty or dead, or wasted land. However, they are the only trees that thrive in salty waters and improve water quality by filtering out nutrients and sediments, and more than 1500 plant and animal species depend on mangroves, including fish and birds, and larger mammals such as monkeys, sloths, tigers, hyenas and African wild dogs. 20% of mangroves worldwide have already disappeared. The main driver for loss is coastal development; buildigns and fish or shrimp farms. The [Mangrove Breakthrough](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/scaling-mangrove-finance-and-strengthening-the-path-for-action-to-cop28/?_gl=1*1yh2nj9*_ga*Njc4MzQ2MjA3LjE2NzAyNTIxMDE.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTY5MTc3MzUzOS41LjEuMTY5MTc3Mzk5Ny4wLjAuMA..), a science-based, measurable, and achievable goal for non-state actors and governments to collectively restore and protect mangroves, has the potential to sequester an estimated 43.5 million tonnes of CO2 through mangrove biomass, and an additional 189 million tons of CO2 in the soil, as well as reducing storm and flood risks for over 15 million people. Additionally, the Global Mangrove Allience [launced](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/the-guardians-of-the-mangrove-forest-in-west-kalimantan-indonesia/?_gl=1*bsqavc*_ga*Njc4MzQ2MjA3LjE2NzAyNTIxMDE.*_ga_7ZZWT14N79*MTY5MTc3MzUzOS41LjEuMTY5MTc3Mzk3My4wLjAuMA..) their [Mangrove Restoration Tracking tool](https://www.mangrovealliance.org/news/new-the-mangrove-restoration-tracker-tool/), an innovative tools providing critical support to restoration efforts by providing real-time data and insights. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Copernicus Marine announced new servises to the cloud-based Marine Data Store](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/introducing-new-copernicus-marine-data-store), offering users expanded functionalities, such as access to enhanced data downloads, improved viewing options, enriched metadata and new post-processing capabilities. The new Marine Data Store will be gradually introduced from October 2023 to June 2024 to ensure a smooth transition. 

**News and updates about applications and programs**
1. [Phylogenetic Explorer](https://legumedata.org/phylogeny/explore/) is a [new visualisation tool](https://www.gbif.org/news/6nt63x4czzdfGJ8EpoWVtg/gbif-phylogeny-explorer-debuts-on-legume-data-portal) that offers a novel view of species occurrence data from the GBIF network in accordance with current phylogenetic evidence on the evolutionary relationships between species within the large, cosmopolitan plant legume family and is able to map occurrences for an entire clade or group of taxa linked by a common ancestor.

2. The [NASA DEVELOP Program, which started as an idea to use the growing availability of satellite imagery to benefit everyday life and the workforce, exists 25 years this year](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/nasa-develop-25-years-science-serving-society). The first part of the mission was to use satellite data to search for Amelia Earhart's plane, which did not succeed (and has still not been found), but the initial team including two undergrads and one high school student, published a paper '[The practical applications of remote sensing](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/pdfs/Practical%20Applications%20of%20Remote%20Sensing%20-%20the%20paper%20that%20started%20it%20all.pdf)' which proved the relevance of remote sensing as well as the need for a program as DEVELOP. Today, the program hosts 10 permanent locations, including five NASA Centers and regional host locations at four universities and a NOAA facility, as well as varying pop-up locations each term. DEVELOP conducts feasibility studies that bridge the gap between earth science information and society by addressing nine thematic areas: agriculture, climate, disasters, ecological conservation, energy, health & air quality, urban development, water resources and wildland fires.

3. [NASA's ARSET (Applied Remote SEnsing Training) program traints its 100,000th participant](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/marking-milestone-earth-data-training). ARSET provides free training on the use of remote sensing observations for agriculture, health & air quality, water resources, ecological conservation, disasts and climate & resilience applications. 

4. [MapTiler is launching new weather layers in MapTiler Cloud and a MapTiler SDK module to visualize weather forecasts](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2023/07/free-weather-sdk-and-api-for-web-maps-and-apps/). The forecast is updated every few hours, giving the most up-to-date information at any given time. The new Premium Weather SDK makes it possible to visualise weather data in 3D, to animate isobars, and to create customised particle animations.

5. The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released [two case studies outlining best practice and lessons learned on environmental and social management in sustainable land use finance](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-impact-frameworks-can-substantiate-sustainable-land-use-investing-two-case-studies). These lessons learned should help other financial institutions to develop their own impact frameworks and ensure that investments generate true environmental and social impacts which are properly tracked and measured, so as to not fall fould of greenwashing claims.

6. [The Copernicus Marine Service is enhancing MyOcean Viewer and the Marine Service Catalogue to improve usability](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-release-copernicus-marine-service-catalogue-viewer). MyOcean Viewer is a free online interactive tool that allows users to view oceanic data with variables such as temperature, salinity, and sea level, for any region in the world. It offers historical, near real-time data as well as forecasts up to 10 days in the future. The Marine Service Catalogue contains redesigned thumbnails, making it easier to distinguish between different products, improving usability, and contains 'depth range', allowing users to filter products based on specific depth intervals.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [A new ethos for environmental data science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/new-ethos-environmental-data-science-santa-barbara-charter) the [Santa Barbara Center](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2023-07/The%20Santa%20Barbara%20Charter_%20Broadening%20Participation%20in%20Environmental%20Data%20Science_final_logo.pdf), a call to action to broaden participation in environmental data science. The document outlines key ideals for this vision, including a 'do no harm' ethos and a push for those in positions of power to make concerted efforts, as well as recommendations for enacting this positive change, from transparency in recruitment to clear codes of conduct to dedicating institutional resources to diversity efforts.

2. [Championing Indigenous Peoples' stewardship of biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/championing-indigenous-peoples-stewardship-of-biodiversity), as their knowledge, innovations and practices ensure the sustainable use of biological resources, carbon sequestration, food security and crop diversity. A [progress review](https://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo5/publication/gbo-5-en.pdf) of previous global targets for nature found limited evidence of countries incorporating traditional and local knowledge into policy development. However, the Kunmig Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and related package of decisions offers a powerful opportunity for inclusion and change by explicitly recognising Indigenous Peoples' rights and contributions to biodiversity.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The WHO, in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization, organised a workshop on biodiversity, traditional knowledge, health and well-being in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The new EU-funded [MARine Coastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations (MARCO-BOLO) project](https://marcobolo-project.eu/) aims to [structure, strengthen, and connect European coastal and marine biodiversity observation capabilities and link these to global efforts such as OBIS, in order to better understand and improve how biodiversity is monitored and protected in marine and coastal environments across Europe and beyond](https://www.obis.org/2023/07/19/mbo-survey-call/). They created [a survey with 25 questions (estimated 10 - 12 minutes to fill out) about experiences and challenges with biodiversity data](https://marcobolo-project.eu/cop-survey/) to assess the data and monitoring needs of diverse stakeholders. The survey closes on the 30st of August.

2. A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02115-8) into the safeguarding of wildlife threatened by international trade has revealed that [more than 900 at-risk animal and plant species (about 40% of species identified as likely threatened), including 370 (critically) endangered species, are not covered by global trade protections](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/more-than-900-at-risk-animal-and-plant-species-not-covered-by-global-trade-protections-new-research-shows).

3. [UNESCO World Heritage Convention and CITES unite to cooperate on conservation and sustainable wildlife trade in species occurring in World Heritage sites](https://cites.org/eng/news/UNESCO-World-Heritage-Convention-and-CITES-unite-to-cooperate-on-conservation-and-sustainable-wildlife-trade-in-species-occurring-in-World-Heritage-sites) in a new effort to ensure the sustainability of trade in species of wild animals and plants occurring in areas of outstanding international importance inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Up to 1/3 of the remaining elephants, tigers and pandas and at least 1 in 10 great apes, lions and rhinos are found in these sites. Collaboration is essential to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of these species and to address illegal harvesting and associated illegal trade that threatens not only the species involved, but also the outstanding universal value of the sites. 

4. [UNESCO provides crucial support to biodiversity in Africa in emergency situations](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2589). The [Rapid Response Facility (RFF)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/rapidresponse/) has quickly mobilised resources to partners on the ground to tackle emergency situations related to civil unrest and conflicts threatening biodiversity, including poaching, illegal logging and deliberate wildfires, massive solid waste accumulation, and the use of snare traps.

5. A recent publication: [Ecosystem services as the silver bullet? A systematic review of how ecosystem services assessments impact biodiversity prioritisation in policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589811623000150). Assessing ecosystem services and assigning an economic value to them has been thought of as a silver bullet to shed light on nature's immense value in a deepening environmental crisis, as they were thought to change policy-makers' minds to prioritise biodiversity in their agendas. This [study aims to provide an overview of the achieved policy impacts, enabling and hindering factors as well as lessons learnt](https://www.es-partnership.org/new-paper-impacts-of-ecosystem-services-and-their-assessments-on-policy/), and found that only 8% of the reviewed articles reported policy impacts, 8% assessed the potential enabling and 2% the hindering factors of their research to influence policy. 

**Climate**
1. Planting the seeds of resilience: [how agroforestry is redefining cocoa farming in Central Africa](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/planting-the-seeds-of-resilience-how-agroforestry-is-redefining-cocoa-farming-in-central-africa/). A new era of sustainable farming is dawning in the heart of Africa, where farmers have pioneered the landscape-level adoption of agroforestry techniques. A notable outcome of this transformation is visible in cocoa production. Traditionally, cocoa farming is often associated with deforestation and forest degradation. The new approach has increased cocoa production while promoting forest restoration; more than 100 hectares have been cultivated following these sustainable guidelines, offering ecological benefits such as carbon sequestration, soil moisture preservation and pest control.

2. [An international financial system at the service of sustainable development](https://sdg-action.org/an-international-financial-system-at-the-service-of-sustainable-development/). The 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals very much incorporates climate, not only through a specific objective (SDG 13: to limit and adapt to climate change), but also through its relevance to the other goals. Yet, the agenda reaches beyond climate for good reason: not everything needed to accomplish it falls under the rubric of climate action or, correspondingly, climate finance. Developed countries' narrow emphasis on climate - and, within it, mitigation more specifically - to the detriment of everything else is reflected most sharply in the financing agendas. The international financial system has become outdated and fragmented, and fails to help developing countries to improve the lives of their citizens, to support the fight against 'new challenges' such as climate change and the digital revolution, and to advance reforms to prevent future global financial crises. 

**Oceans**
1. The [Aral Sea Disaster over a 60-year period](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/75e4cb0a8a1a4e06995ad8466915c8de): a story map. The Aral Sea, between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, was the world's fourth largest saline lake, and was home to several endemic fish, marine animals and plants, and held significant importance for transport, fisheries, climate and society. Since 1964, the water level has decreased by 75% of its original size, as the waters of its source rivers were diverted for irrigation for cotton cultivation.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [registration](https://challenge.aiforgood.itu.int/match/matchitem/83) for the [new global challenge promoting artificial intelligence for water, agriculture and energy sustainability](https://www.itu.int/hub/2023/07/new-competitions-to-advance-climate-action-with-ai/) is open until the 30th of September 2023. The climate action challenge aims to create an innovation ecosystem where collaborative problem-solving will help bring promising AI solutions to global scale.

**Biodiversity**
1. On the 29th of June, it was the [International Day of the Tropics](https://www.un.org/en/observances/tropics-day), celebrating the extraordinary diversity of the tropics while highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities nations of the Tropics face. Tropical forests are home to two-thirds of global biodiversity, tropical coral reefs support 25-35% of the marine species, more than 95% of the world's corals and mangroves are found in the Tropics and globally, populations of native Tropical species on land have fallen by at least 20% since 1900. The [decline of biodiversity in the Tropics undermines economic stability](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/spotlighting-unep-wcmcs-work-for-people-and-nature-in-the-tropics), as natural processes such as providing food, clean air and water, nutrients and climate regulation are disrupted. Action to protect biodiversity in the Tropics is urgently needed to realise the ambitions of the Glasgow Climate Pact and the GBF. 

2. [Tropical primary forest loss was 4.1 million hectares (out of which 1.8 million hectares in Brazil) in 2022](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2022/) (which can be visualised as a loss of forest area of 11 football fields per minute), which was a much higher loss than in 2021. The increased forest loss comes in the first year after the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration  on Forests and Land Use to halt and reverse forest loss by the end of the decade, recognising the important role of forests in combating climate change and biodiversity loss.

3. Private companies and vendors operating in the ocean space collect a lot of oceanographic and meteorological data. Only a few companies share this data to fill scientific gaps, inform decision making and generate sustainable solutions. Some companies do not realise the importance of this data, others face legal, technical or financial barriers. In March 2023, the Norwegian non-profit foundation HUB Ocean and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO teamed up to bring together ocean scientists and private companies to find out what data is needed by science and explore what the potential mutual benefits might be gained from sharing this data. [Three modelling use cases, which were considered to deliver business value to industry and for which it was considered feasible for companies to provide the data, were discussed](https://oceandecade.org/news/how-industrial-ocean-data-can-fill-scientific-data-gaps/): 1. optimising offshore designs and operations, including better planned interventions and lower maintenance costs, optimised infrastructure designs that are safer and more durable, 2. reducing costs predicting extreme weather like storm surges, meteotsunamis, heatwaves, and others on industrial assets and operations at sea through early warning systems and timely forecasts, and 3. estimating coastal shelf impact, like coastal erosion, sediment dynamics, and degradation of habitats like wetlands on installations such as power and fibre cables on the seafloor, affecting people and industries.  

4. [Strengthening cooperation for sustainable and legal trade in fish and fish products](https://cites.org/eng/news/Strengthening-cooperation-for-sustainable-and-legal-trade-in-fish-and-fish-products), which are among the most highly traded wildlife commodities. The [CITES Animals Committee dove into review of significant trade in sharks, rays and other animals species](https://cites.org/eng/news/CITES-Animals-Committee-dives-into-review-of-significant-trade-in-sharks-rays-and-other-animal-species-at-32nd-Meeting) at its 32nd meeting. Sharks and rays were selected for the first time for the Review of Significant Trade, a process designed to identify species that may be subject to unsustainable levels of international trade and identify problems and solutions concerning effective implementation of the Convention.

5. [Meeting of all African Range States results in agreement on  key priorities for the urgent conservation and sustainable management of four iconic African carnivore species](https://cites.org/eng/news/Meeting-of-all-African-Range-States-results-in-agreement-on-key-priorities-for-iconic-African-carnivore-species): the African lion, cheetah, leopard and African wild dog. The populations of these species are increasingly threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation, land use conversion, illegal trade and illegal or incidental killing. The discussed conservation priorities include: strengthening policies and actions to enhance human-carnivore coexistence, improving information and tools available by enhancing data management processes, developing resource kits and providing advice to Range States on the development of infectious disease management plans. 

**Oceans**
1. [Reef futures: exploring the ecosystem services and potential futures of coral reefs](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/reef-futures-exploring-the-ecosystem-services-and-potential-futures-of-coral-reefs). Over the past 4 years, the Reef Futures project has explored the delivery of five ecosystem services: 1. biomass production, 2. nutrient cycling, 3. carbon cycling, 4. cultural value and 5. nutritional value. Climate change is the most pervasive threat in many tropical coastal countries to the supply of essential micronutrients from marine fish catches. Countries may be able to adapt their fisheries to switch from vulnerable species to alternative micronutrient-rich species that are resilient to climate change and overfishing, and which are currently under-represented within catches.

2. [20% of major actions within the Built Environment sector, a key contributor to global energy-related carbon emissions and resource extraction, have pledged commitment to the Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/built-environment-reaches-tipping-point-as-20-of-key-actors-join-the-race-to-zero/). This 20% commitment is known as the 'breakthrough ambition', a point where enough momentum is gathered among a critical mass of key actors, enabling them to deviate from the business-as-usual trajectory and collectively deliver breakthrough outcomes swiftly. This 20% is seen as a tipping point, because systematic change is not linear, but exponential, so when 20% of the market leaders begin moving, the rate of transition accelerates, and a point of no return is crossed.

3. The [new Copernicus Capability for Tropic Ocean Networks project](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/advancing-conservation-ocean-biodiversity-through-copernicus-marine-service-evolution) aims to expand the Copernicus Marine Service product catalogue by delivering new and improved biogeochemical products, such as new models of higher trophic levels, the benthic habitat and marine pollution, with the aim to better inform ocean policymakers, managers and the public. They are using a three-pronged approach that: 1. integrates biotic and abiotic components, habitats, trophic levels and stressors, 2. combines ecosystem models, satellite data, and in situ observations with artificial intelligence, machine learning and data assimilation, and 3. interlinks current Copernicus Marine Service biogeochemical and physical models with ecosystem model components. 

4. [Guardians of the sea: the deep connection of the Yag√°n People with the ocean](https://www.besnet.world/guardians-of-the-sea-the-deep-connection-of-the-yagan-people-with-the-ocean/): a webpage with information on the southernmost regions of the Americas, and how their wisdom and connections to the marine and coastal ecosystems hold valuable insights into pressing challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.

5. [The Republic of Cabo Verde, a small island developing state made up of 99% sea and 1% land, has joined the Ocean Decade Alliance](https://oceandecade.org/news/cabo-verde-joins-the-ocean-decade-alliance/), which was created to bring together global leaders around a collective, worldwide, UN-led effort to resolve some of the most pressing [ocean challenges](https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).

6. The number of submissions from individuals and institutions in Africa and the Adjacent Island States has lagged behind other regions regarding the 10 Ocean Decade Challenges. Taking this into account, as well as the growing degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems in Africa, an [information webinar on the 2nd of June brought together stakeholders to discuss advances and next steps in catalysing science-based solutions to achieve the ocean wanted](https://oceandecade.org/news/moving-forward-implementation-of-ocean-decade-in-africa/) as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030. The expert panel pointed out the importance of ecosystem restoration using area-based management tools for the conservation, protection and reversing the decline of ocean ecosystems. Speakers also highlighted sustainable ocean management and ocean and human health in Africa as top of priorities identified by the Ocean Decade Africa Roadmap.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [first (online) hackathon organised by the OEMC project, held from  the 1st of September to the 15th of September, 2023, challenges young researchers to map land cover](https://earthmonitor.org/the-first-hackathon-of-the-oemc-project/), using land cover, land use, irrigation management and structural elements of European landscapes, using machine learning. The participant with the highest accuracy wins the challenge, and will be invited to present their results at the OEMC Global Workshop in Bolzano, Italy.

2. To [manage and protect forests, from policies to on-the-ground action, governments, companies, Indigenous Peoples and civil society need information on where forests are gaining or losing carbon](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/whats-new-carbon-flux-monitoring/). Global Forest Watch's  geospatial forest carbon flux monitoring framework is based on the land use, land-use change and forestry part of the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use guidelines developed by the IPCC. In addition to the annual updates to tree cover loss and the drivers of tree cover loss, there were 5 additional updates: 1. locally variable root biomass (improving the local estimation of belowground biomass in places where the root-shoot ratio is significantly different from the global average), 2. tree cover gain through 2020 (improving emissions and removals estimates), 3. higher resolution forest fire data (the 500-m data was replaced by 30-m data), 4. updated peat extent (by including published regional maps), and 5. updated Global Warming Potential values (using the values from the 6th IPCC assessment report). 

3. As part of the Mosquito Week (18 - 25 June), three mosquito-related projects supported by NASA's Health and Air Quality Program were highlighted: 1. Tracking malaria in Africa, for which project information on surface temperatures, precipitation and vegetation health were included on the online platform District Health Information Software 2, 2. Under a NASA grant, a [Malaria Early Warning System](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12603) was developed for Peru, which [makes it possible to forecast malaria outbreaks up to 12 weeks in advance](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/news/how-nasa-helps-fight-mosquitoes-space), using satellite data, and 3. Combatting California's mosquitoes, where the invasive mosquito species Aedes can carry diseases like Zika, dengue and yellow fever.   

4. [Make sustainable and healthy food the easy choice, says the Group of Chief Advisors on sustainable food consumption](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/make-sustainable-and-healthy-food-easy-choice-says-group-chief-scientific-advisors-2023-06-28_en). With the urgent need for change, the scientists deliver a strong advice: unburden consumers and pave the path for a future in which sustainable, nutritious food is the easy and inexpensive option. Increasing the information available to consumers has been proven insufficient; individuals' eating choices are impacted by a variety of variables other than rational thought. Factors to consider are food availability, personal habits and routines, cultural and traditional influences, emotional and impulsive responses, and economic and social conditions. 

5. [One Ecosystem, a scientific journal closely tied to the Ecosystem Service Partnership has successfully completed the rigorous quality and integrity assessment at Web of Science](https://www.es-partnership.org/one-ecosystem-selected-for-inclusion-in-the-web-of-science/).

**News and updates about applications**
1. A new tool available on the Global Forest Review, the [Targets Tracker](https://gfw.global/3L1xFpo), enables the [use of tree cover loss data to measure progress toward deforestation commitments on a global level](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/2022-tree-cover-loss-data-explained/) by using a coarse resolution proxy of deforestation. The tracker identifies losses that are likely to represent deforestation in and outside of the tropics by only including tree cover loss from certain drivers, such as the expension of small-scale agriculture and loss in commodity-driven deforestation and urbanisation, while excluding temporary losses as fires and forestry activities.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [A fairer future for Open Science: choosing community over commercialisation with equitable article processing charges](https://upstream.force11.org/fairer-future-for-open-science-choosing-community-over-commercialization-with-equitable-article-processing-charges/). The Open Access movement has revolutionised the accessibility of scholarly research, aiming to make knowledge freely available to all. A persistent obstacle remains: article processing charges. These charges are causing a significant hesitancy among authors to publish in Open Access journals, and carry profound implications for the advancement of science and could be a significant threat to the principles of open science.

2. Between 1975 and 1989, 96% of the internationally traded animals were taken from the wild. Now, 50 years after signing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the majority of international trade in animals are captive-bred. The [32nd Meeting fo the CITES Animals Committee took place from 19 - 23 June, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland, where the trade in captive-bred animals was discussed](https://cites.org/eng/news/Review-of-international-trade-in-wild-and-captive-bred-animals-future-zoonotic-disease-emergence-among-discussion-topics-for-upcoming-CITES-meeting), and new species, including sharks and rays, West African vultures, pangolins and Saiga antelopes were reviewed under the [Review of Significant Trade Resolution](https://cites.org/eng/imp/sigtradereview) and the [Captive Breeding Resolution](https://cites.org/eng/prog/captive-breeding).

Two other yachts collect samples for monitoring microplastic pollution, and a fifth team gathers information on ocean biodiversity. All five yachts have an on-board weather station. All of the valuable data collected are openly shared with the Ocean Race's science partners and fed into global databases and through a specially designed [interactive tool](https://theoceanracescience.com/).

**Oceans**
1. On the 8th of June, World Oceans Day, the [Ocean Decade announced the official endorsement of 47 new Decade Actions, strengthening the momentum for ocean knowledge-based solutions](https://oceandecade.org/news/a-new-wave-of-transformative-decade-actions-boosts-the-ocean-decade-global-movement-on-the-road-to-2030/), addressing priority ocean science  issues such as community resilience to ocean hazards, the creation of a digital representation of the ocean, sustainable ocean economy, ocean literacy and capacity development. There were also a number of events held to raise [awareness to the issues and risks of deoxygenation across the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/highlighting-ocean-deoxygenation-on-world-oceans-day/). The increase of water bodies with very little or no oxygen, which are called dead zones, have a direct impact on the health of aquatic life and coastal communities that rely on the ocean for food and income. 

2. [Ending overfishing could help tackle nutrient deficiencies for millions worldwide](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/06/08/ending-overfishing-could-help-tackle-nutrient-deficiencies-for-millions-worldwide). The ocean provides protein for over 3 billion people worldwide. The UN projects that 96 million tonnes of catch can be produced by 2030, but that another 16 million tonnes could be made available if there was no overfishing. This increased catch could reduce iron deficiencies in 4 million people and vitamin B12 deficiencies in 18 million people as well as provide enough Omega-3 fatty acids for 38 million people, when not only the amount of seafood will be increased, but also the availability for the most under-nourished populations will be improved.

Progress has been made in the talks and agreement by states to develop a first iteration of the treaty text (a 'zero draft') ahead of the next round of negotiations in November in Kenya. [Many solutions have been proposed to address plastic pollution](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/world-environment-day-moving-towards-a-plastic-free-world), such as scaling up reusable products and making them more profitable, making recycling plastics more profitable by improving recycling and finding materials to replace plastics and ensuring these are better alternatives to plastics. On the 5th of June, [World Environment Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/environment-day), the role of the environment in our lives and the need for a shift in our lifestyle to accommodate sustainable living in harmony with nature, in a plastic-free world, was recognised.

2. The [action plan for a sustainable planet in the digital age](https://www.sparkblue.org/codesactionplanlaunch) has been launched, offering a vision on three systematic shifts (1. align vision values objectives, 2. sustainable digitalisation and 3. digitalisation for sustainability)with a set of 9 global Impact Initiatives to spark immediate collective action and multi-stakeholder collaboration.

3. All human activity at sea will be revealed through the Global Fishing Watch, a [new initiative to apply AI and satellite data to help end illegal fishing](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-to-reveal-all-human-activity-at-sea-with-investment-through-the-audacious-project/) and safeguard the ocean, by combining GPS data and using machine learning to publicly display the activity of all industrial fishing vessels and small-scale fishing boats and cargo ships, as well as aquaculture pens, wind farms and oil rigs.

4. The emergence of new Earth observation data has radically improved the ability to map tree cover, while automated methods and lower computing costs have accelerated the production of data sets to inform our understanding of the global distribution of trees. [Global Forest Watch hosts three tree cover data sets: Tree Canopy Cover, Tree Cover Height and Tropical Tree Cover](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/tree-cover-data-comparison/), which vary in geographic and temporal coverage, resolution, the definition of tree cover and other characteristics to make each best suited for different use cases.

### Issue 11

Date: May 30th, 2023

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. On the 22nd of May it was the [international day for Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/idb/). The theme this year was 'From agreement to action: build back biodiversity', and it called on communities at all scales to step up and show their commitment to moving from the agreement of new targets for nature to action, so that these commitments can be realised. [CITES sent its congratulations for the historical agreement on the Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V5dq_R9vB0). The director-general of [UNESCO addressed the urgency of tackling the challenge of preserving nature and its living fabric](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2565), as she points out that there are barely two years left to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C by the end of the century. Failure to do so would be a failure to preserve the habitability of our world and the diversity of species that inhabit it. 

2. On Biodiversity Day 2023 the [vital links between biodiversity and global trade and how both impact the resilience and well-being of communities around the world](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/reflecting-on-the-crucial-co-dependance-of-biodiversity-and-international-trade) were explored. About 30 percent of threats to species globally are driven by international trade, and nearly 70 percent of tropical deforestation is due to commercial agriculture, from which most of the products are traded internationally. Although trade in natural and agricultural goods is a key driver of economic growth, it can also result in the depletion of wild animal and plant populations. For example, the palm oil industry has positively contributed to smallholders' wellbeing and financial security, but the commercial plantations in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa have resulted in land degradation, affecting other crops and wild species. The loss of biodiversity also exacerbates the effects of climate change, as deforestation releases greenhouse gasses and reduces the environment's ability to buffer and recover from extreme weather events.

3. Also on Biodiversity Day, the [National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans Forum 2.0](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/nbsap-forum/elearning/) was [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/nbsap-forum-2-0-launches-to-help-nations-meet-2030-targets-for-nature), an online platform for biodiversity experts working on national efforts towards the latest internationally agreed targets for nature. Via the Forum 2.0, UNEP-WCMC provides countries with technical support, learning and guidance materials to help them understand and incorporate new targets, develop clear financing plans for implementation and prepare for national monitoring.

4. [WWF report highlights 380 new species discoveries in the Greater Mekon region](https://asiapacific.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/new_species_discoveries/new_species_discoveries_2021_2022/), Southeast Asia, in 2021 and 2022. Many of these new (to science) species are under threat of extinction, and [WWF is calling for an increase of protection for these species and their habitats](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-report-highlights-380-new-species-discoveries-in-the-greater-mekong-region). 

5. Grasslands are essential to livelihoods and food security, and critical for biodiversity and nature, holding approximately one third of global terrestrial carbon stocks and providing critical resilience in the face of climate change. However, more than 70% of America's prairies have been destroyed. A [new brief from WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/saving-our-grasslands-why-they-matter-why-we-are-losing-them-and-how-we-can-save-them) details [policy actions](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-outlines-policy-actions-to-save-grasslands) the US government must take to conserve grassland prairie habitats.

6. [UNEP-WCMC welcomed the launch of new private sector guidance on setting targets for nature](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-welcomes-launch-of-nature-targets-and-guidance-for-businesses), released by a major global consortium of conservation and development organisations and finance and sustainability experts, called [the Science Based Targets Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/). The new targets expand the existing Science Based Targets for climate, and address impacts on ecosystems through reducing conversion and land occupation, encouraging landscape level engagement and tackling water consumption and pollution. 

7. The UK's largest insurance company, Aviva, demonstrates a [strong commitment to address environmental issues, particularly deforestation and biodiversity loss with a ¬£38m to restore lost temperate rainforests in the UK](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/avivas-biodiversity-efforts-continue-with-38m-pledge-to-restore-lost-uk-rainforests/), by planting a combination of native tree species and supporting the Woodland Carbon Scheme, which aims to deliver carbon removal, boost air quality and improve biodiversity through woodland creation and peat restoration.

[Navigating the complex world of carbon markets: the path to high-quality credits for ecosystem restoration](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/navigating-the-complex-world-of-carbon-markets-the-path-to-high-quality-credits-for-ecosystem-restoration). The voluntary carbon market enables private actors to finance greenhouse gas removal or abatement activities outside regulated or mandatory carbon pricing instruments, and facilitates the generation and trading of carbon credits and offsetting of carbon emissions. Its increased popularity led to increased scrutiny and calls for transparency, to ensure that genuine contributions to climate change mitigation are being delivered.

2. An international group of fourteen experts from different backgrounds are going [to prepare a report building the evidence base for how action tackling both the climate emergency and sustainable development challenges synergistically can be a win-win solution, maximizing impact](https://sdgs.un.org/blog/expert-group-prepare-report-analysing-climate-and-sdg-synergies-aiming-maximize-action-impact).

3. [Major companies push for a net zero nature-positive world](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/redefining-corporate-responsibility-major-companies-push-for-a-net-zero-nature-positive-world/) by recognising the importance of mitigating their own environmental impact, advocating for systemic change and inspiring others to follow suit. 

**Oceans**
1. California has one of the most extensive networks of Marine Protected Areas in the world. The important question now is: is it working? NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis) is leading a [ten-year review of California's MPA network](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/MPA-decadal-review), which is also addressing the [legacy of exclusion of Indigenous perspectives and priorities](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=207753&inline) as well as the [Nature Futures Framework](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10146), which is designed to emphasize positive human-nature relationships.  

2. [Tropical cyclones: why we must observe the ocean to better protect people on land](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=454:tropical-cyclones-why-we-must-observe-the-ocean-to-better-protect-people-on-land&catid=13&Itemid=125). In 2011 Hurricane Irene was supposed to be a devastating storm, but fizzled out. In 2012, when the alerts about Hurricane Sandy came up, it was very difficult to convince people of the powerfulness of the storm. Underwater vehicles collecting ocean observations were deployed during both these events. Since 2018, the data collected from these underwater vehicles is included into hurricane forecast models, contributing to timely and more accurate warnings. 

3. The Fisherman Weather Field School, a project under the UN Ocean Decade Observing Together programme, helps fishermen to use ocean information to protect themselves and save lives in their communities by [bridging the gap between ocean data and users in local fishing communities, improving ocean literacy and enabling fishers to use ocean and weather information](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=455:ocean-information-is-saving-lives-in-indonesian-coastal-communities&catid=13&Itemid=125) in their daily activities. 

4. Sargassum, a type of free-floating seaweed typically found in the Sargasso Sea, has caused significant ecological and economic problems in recent years due to its rapid growth and spread. Changes in ocean currents have driven the seaweed to new areas, and the increase in dissolved carbon dioxide levels, an influx of nutrients from the Amazon and Congo Rivers and strong converging winds leading to exposure to high sunlight are possibly promoting their growth. Large accumulations of sargassum have been increasingly causing environmental and socio-economic problems in recent years, particularly along the Caribbean and West African coasts, as dense mats of seaweed smother coral reefs and seagrass beds, depriving them of sunlight and oxygen, which in turn declines marine life, such as fish, crustaceans and other organisms that rely on these habitats for food and shelter. The seaweed entangles fishing gear and boats and hinder the nesting of sea turtles. Additionally, thick layers of decaying seaweed release foul odours and produce hydrogen sulphide gas, which can be harmful to humans and wildlife, and deters tourists. The [Sargassum Operational Detection Algorithms (SODA) project, aims to monitor and track sargassum](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sargassum-invasion-combating-seaweed-crisis-copernicus-marine-data). Satellite imagery, provided by Copernicus, will be used for SODA, with the end goal to provide reliable and accurate data to stakeholders, so that informed decisions for sargassum management and mitigation efforts can be made.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [Zero Food Waste Coalition](https://zerofoodwastecoalition.org/) released [Achieving Zero Food Waste: A State Policy Toolkit](https://zerofoodwastecoalition.org/state-toolkit/), highlighting [opportunities for state actors to accelerate their leadership on food waste reduction policy](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/zero-food-waste-coalition-highlights-state-policy-opportunities-to-reduce-food-waste). 

2. [WWF is calling for a global ban on harmful and unnecessary single-use plastic items](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-calls-for-a-global-ban-on-harmful-and-unnecessary-single-use-plastic-items-such-as-vapes-cutlery-and-cosmetic-microplastics-ahead-of-key-un-plastic-pollution-treaty-talks), such as vapes, cutlery and cosmetic microplastics among others, ahead of the UN plastic pollution treaty talks taking place in Paris from May 29th to June 2nd 2023. 

3. Modeled after the success of the Ocean Health Index, the [Western Wildlife Resilience Index](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/announcing-WWRI), the first holistic quantitative metric of wildfire resilience, was developed, to enhance decision making and improve the management and well-being of ecosystems and communities.

4. Planet officially launched their [Startup Program](https://www.planet.com/startup/) which enables [early-stage startups to build novel applications powered by Planet's data](https://www.planet.com/startup/), by offering discounted access to Planet data for R&D, product development, and prototyping purposes to help make global change visible, accessible and actionable. 

5. The 2022 SDG Progress Report suggested that progress toward many of the targets that underpin the SDGs has stalled or even gone backwards. One of the critical barriers has been that the level of investment and financial support for the SDGs has not been sufficient, the bap between required and delivered investment was estimated to approximately USD 3.9 trillion. [The private finance sector is increasingly interested in sustainability issues and the SDGs](https://sdg-action.org/learning-from-climate-finance/): over 4,500 asset owners and asset managers are signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment and over 300 banks (representing almost half of the global banking industry) are signatories to the Principles for Responsible Banking, thereby committing to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment and lending practices, and to engage with companies to encourage better management of these ESG factors. Governments need to focus on addressing the barriers to capital investment in emerging economies and to establish and implement SDG delivery plans that encourage meaningful action on the SDGs across economic sectors. [Blended finance involves the targeted use of concessional financing to attract new sources of investment in projects that may otherwise be perceived as too risky for private finance](https://sdg-action.org/unlocking-the-potential-of-blended-finance/), as it improves the [risk-return characteristics of an investment by pooling capital with different financial and non-financial return expectations](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-it-takes-to-attract-private-investment-to-climate-adaptation/) within an investment structure. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) provides a useful guide to the impact of blended finance and how its potential can be further unlocked. In addition to climate change mitigation, the GEF has applied blended finance to address and accelerate nature-based solutions related to land, water, biodiversity and resilience.

**Biodiversity**
1. On Saturday May 13th it was [World Migratory Bird Day](https://www.worldmigratorybirdday.org/news/2023/press-release-world-migratory-bird-day-2023-highlights-impact-growing-water-crisis), a global campaign that aims to raise awareness of migratory birds and the need for international cooperation to conserve them. This year, [the importance of water for migratory birds and calls to protect water resources and aquatic ecosystems were highlighted](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2559).

2. [Combating the illegal trade in big cats - 28 countries come together as part of CITES Big Cats Task Force](https://cites.org/eng/news/combating-the-illegal-trade-in-big-cats-28-countries-come-together-as-part-of-cites-big-cats-task-force_04052023), focusing on big cat species that are of highest concern from a conservation and illegal trade perspective: cheetah, mainland clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard, lion, jaguar, leopard, tiger and snow leopard. Big cats are affected by illegal international trade and have been targeted for their furs, teeth, bones and other body parts, as well as for live animal trade. The [outcome from the CITES Big Cats Task Force meeting](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/EST/Big_Cat_Task_Force_Final_outcome_document.pdf) will be presented to the 77th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, in November 2023.

3. A [new interactive website showcasing the latest scientific research on the health of and the benefits provided by four important marine systems, kelp, coral reefs, seagrass meadows and mangroves](https://www.unep.org/interactives/why-blue-ecosystems-matter/) was [launched by the UN Environmental Programme](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/understanding-how-mangrove-loss-threatens-biodiversity). 

4. [Accessing GBIF-mediated occurrence data to conserve evolutionary distinct and globally endangered (EDGE) species](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/accessing-occurrence-data-to-conserve-edge-species/) in a exploratory study looking at data availability and species occurrence identification outside existing protected areas for EDGE species in Benin, Ecuador and Vietnam. The majority of EDGE species had data available in GBIF, and the lower percentage of occurrence records available outside protected areas suggest either a sampling bias within protected areas or a concentration of those species within protected areas. 

**Climate**
1. [UNFF Director Juliette Biao: 'Sustainable forest management critical to undoing centuries of damage'](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/unff-director-juliette-biao-sustainable-forest-management-critical-to-undoing-centuries-of-damage/). Despite the immense value of forests, as carbon sinks, part of the hydrological cycle, and habitat to 80% of all land-based species, 420 million hectares of forest were lost over the last two decades. Over half of the loss is due to conversion of forest land into cropland and livestock grazing accounts for almost 40%. The key challenge is how to manage the ongoing increase in agricultural production, and improve food security, without reducing overall forest areas.

**Oceans**
1. [26 Ocean biodiversity and bycatch reduction projects recipients of annual MSC research grants](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2023/05/10/ocean-biodiversity-and-bycatch-reduction-projects-among-recipients-of-annual-msc-research-grants) of nearly $1 million that will better protect the ocean and support sustainable fishing. One project will help the protection of loggerhead sea turtles in the waters around the island of R√©union, where to date more than 400 turtles have been rescued who got accidently injured by fishing.

**News and updates about applications**
1. MapTiler has been creating a comprehensive mapping ecosystem for businesses, including advanced processing tools like Desktop/Engine, data storage and processing services, QGIS plugins, geocoding and geolocation services, JavaScript libraries, map styling tools and more. Now they created their own software development kit, and [provide a comprehensive explanation and tutorial](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2023/05/maptiler-sdk-javascript-maps-on-steroids/).

It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates. 

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [Zenodo celebrated its 10th anniversary](https://www.openaire.eu/zenodo-celebrating-our-10th-anniversary). It currently supports more than 300,000 researchers in more than 7500 research organisations in 153 countries, and is a core enabler of open science practice by providing trusted long-term storage. 

2. [What is responsible knowledge exchange, engagement and impact?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/05/03/what-is-responsible-knowledge-exchange-engagement-and-impact/) A framework was developed to understand and develop responsible knowledge exchange, engagement and impact, including: 1. integrity and ethics, by being attentive to whether there is sufficient formal or informal reflection and scrutiny of ethical issues in setting up, conducting and drawing benefits from projects, 2. equity, diversity and inclusion, such as the need for greater focus and scrutiny of the power asymmetries and barriers, 3. sustainability and reciprocity, 4. contextual sensitivity across different cultures and across experiential contexts, 5. sharing and openness, for example regarding the protection of the confidentiality of participants and preserving relationships of trust, and 6. support and recognition. These ideas will be developed into workshops, publications, resources and a follow-up project, and [ideas and collaborations are welcomed](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/alis-oancea/).

3. [Does generative AI contribute to more culturally inclusive higher education and research?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/05/04/bridge-or-barrier-does-generative-ai-contribute-to-more-culturally-inclusive-higher-education-and-research/) Chat GPT is already a good translator across various languages, which holds promise for intercultural communication, as it might lower the publishing barrier for early researchers with lower levels of English proficiency.

**Biodiversity**
1. [India's wild tiger numbers continue to grow](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/india-s-wild-tiger-numbers-continue-to-grow). Since 2010 the number of wild tigers more than doubled from 1411 to 3167 in 2022. Project Tiger was conceptualised with the goal to restore tiger populations and protect their habitats in India, and is now recognised as one of the most successful species-specific conservation programs worldwide.

2. Habitat loss, human population growth and conservation successes lead to humans and wild animals living in closer proximity and sharing the same scarce resources, with hundreds of humans and thousands of animals dying yearly due to human-wildlife conflicts yearly. At the [international conference on Human-Wildlife Conflict and Coexistence in Oxford, UK, the insights, solutions and required collaboration across disciplines and sectors to foster healthy and beneficial co-existence of people and wildlife were discussed and debated](https://cites.org/eng/node/136188). The focus now is on translating the commitments at the international level into concrete actions on the ground supported by sufficient funds to implement and sustain actions, including actions to address human wildlife conflict and promote coexistence. The next challenges will be to connect the funding sources and the areas where funds are the most needed.

**Climate**
1. [The future of water](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/future-forward-the-future-of-water/). To address the water crisis in East Java, Indonesia, local communities safeguard springs and clear rivers of rubbish.

### Issue 7

Date: April 4th, 2023

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Exploring the vital role of our forests](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/exploring-the-vital-role-of-our-forests). Forests are key to combating climate change, purify water and air, prevent natural disasters (by reducing soil erosion, helping decrease the impact of storm surges and tsunamis and reducing the risk of wildfires), provide soil for agriculture and are home to a wealth of biodiversity (80% of amphibian species, 75% of bird species and 68% of mammal species, and 60% of all vascular plant species occur in tropical forests). 

**Climate**
1. [Leaders urged to heed science and act now to avert climate catastrophe](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/leaders-urged-to-heed-science-and-act-now-to-avert-climate-catastrophe). WWF scientists call on governments to accelerate action to phase out fossil fuels, slash emissions and restore nature.

2. [Marine ecosystems in a changing climate - Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf), a report published by the Ocean & Climate Platform. [Marine ecosystems are critical to climate mitigation and adaptation](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/), and are also increasingly vulnerable to climatic and human stressors, with some already reaching a tipping point. Transformational changes must be carried out to jointly and effectively deploy adaptation and mitigation responses at a large scale, as marine ecosystems provide so many benefits to the living world and are cornerstones of the transition to a more sustainable world.

3. [Climate group: without climate finance for states and regions there can be no net zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/without-climate-finance-for-states-and-regions-there-can-be-no-net-zero-warns-climate-group/). The Climate Group published a [new study](https://www.theclimategroup.org/media/20736/download) discussing mechanisms that state and regional governments can use to raise money to accelerate to net zero and adapt to climate change, and how subnational governments can effectively spend climate finance. As state and regional governments represent over 50% of all environment and climate spending, funding for climate action and policies at subnational level is essential to keep the world on track for 1.5¬∞C of warming. 

4. Race to Zero has released its [Data Explorer](http://www.racetozerodataexplorer.org/), a new [tool, developed by Climate Arc, showcasing climate data from the largest (by revenue) 500 companies in the Race to Zero campaign](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-campaign-launches-new-tool-to-enhance-transparency-of-net-zero-commitments/). Nearly two thirds of the companies published a plan to get to net zero by 2050, and almost 80% published historical emissions data. The tool reveals the differences in quantity and quality of the [data published](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-data-explorer-faqs/), and finds that about 30% of companies are not reporting the full impact of their activities.

5. Although we are way off-target on the commitment to stabilize temperature rises to 1.5¬∞C, there was also some good news in the report, as [the 1.5¬∞C target is still viable](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/exponential-roadmap-initiative-and-now-for-the-good-news-from-the-ipcc-report-the-1-5c-target-is-still-viable/). All solutions are already here, are scalable, can be deployed rapidly, and are affordable. The [key to rapid change is to identify the feedback loops where behavioural change and political, economic and technological shifts create self-reinforcing cycles](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/comment-now-good-news-ipcc-report-15c-target-is-still-viable-2023-03-22/), driving ever-greater action and a green race to the top.

6. [Global, regional and country temperature change statistics from 1961 - 2022](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1635307/) show that [in 2022 the mean annual temperatures were warmer than normal in nearly 85% of all countries and territories for which statistics were available](https://www.fao.org/3/cc5064en/cc5064en.pdf). 


**Oceans**
1. The latest [Allen Coral Atlas impact report reveals the highlights from 2022](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/atlas-2022-impact-report/), including a dynamic [Turbidity dataset](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#turbidity), a new [Coral Reef Extent dataset](https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/nauru-coral-reef-data-allen-coral-atlas), [10 habitat mapping regions with custom improvements](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#habitatmaps) and [integrated Marine Protected Areas](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/#mpas).

2. Collective action to create 'the ocean we want', by [officially endorsing 35 new Decade Actions](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-decade-announces-wave-of-over-thirty-new-endorsed-actions/) that are collectively working in all ocean basins, strengthening the global momentum for ocean knowledge-based solutions.

3. The [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) [released its annual list of the top-ten remarkable new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/ten-remarkable-new-marine-species-from-2022/) (out of almost 1,700 marine species, including about 300 fossil species) described in 2022.

4. [Insights from the IPCC's sixth assessment report](https://oceandecade.org/news/what-ocean-for-tomorrow-marine-ecosystems-in-a-changing-climate-change-insights-from-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report/): '[What ocean for tomorrow?](https://ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIFCO-2023-EN-WEB.pdf)' In the path to a sustainable future, it is crucial to make the protection of the ocean and its ecosystems a priority.

5. [Public and private sectors to advance ocean observing](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=448:public-and-private-sectors-to-advance-ocean-observing&catid=13&Itemid=125): "Today ocean observing activities  mostly rely on public funding, but this will not be sufficient to expand a sustained ocean observing system to meet the growing demands for ocean information." A collaboration between the public and private sectors can bring benefits to both sides across the whole ocean observing value chain. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Forest Watcher updates improve managing teams and reporting on data from the field](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/forest-watcher-mobile-app-updates/). Available data on recently detected tree cover loss and fires, combined with strong existing knowledge from the community, has made investigating potentially illegal clearings and fires within Buen Jard√≠n de Callaru and many other communities across the tropics more efficient.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAire started a podcast](https://www.openaire.eu/let-s-talk-about-open-science) on exploring Open Science principles and practices in Europe, called [Open-ON-AIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/podcasts). In the first episode the human network powering the Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe is being discussed, and the second episode revolves around the OpenAIRE Graph and how it can be used to unlock the power of open science data and create new opportunities. Future episodes will explore a range of topics related to Open Science, their challenges and the sollutions to facilitate the transition towards more responsible and transparent scholarly communication. 

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**

**Biodiversity**
1. [Understanding the dimensions of the Global Biodiversity Framework and our pathway to the 2030 targets and 2050 vision](https://geobon.org/understanding-the-dimensions-of-the-global-biodiversity-framework-and-our-pathway-to-the-2030-targets-and-2050-vision/). The post-2020 GBF is inarguably the most important piece of global biodiversity legislation in over a decade. A new [paper by Alice Hughes in Integrative Conservation discusses the process, strengths and weaknesses of the GBF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inc3.16).

**Climate**
1. [IPCC lead author Paulina Aldunce: 'What is everyone waiting for?'](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/ipcc-lead-author-paulina-aldunce-what-is-everyone-waiting-for/): The IPCC opened its 58th session to complete the last elements of its [Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/): the synthesis report and its summary for policymakers. The evidence and urgency scientists provide isn't reflected in decision-making.  

2. [Scientists deliver 'final warning' on climate crisis: act now or it's too late](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ipcc-climate-crisis-report-delivers-final-warning-on-15c). The comprehensive review of human knowledge of the climate crisis, the final part of its sixth assessment report, took eight years to compile, and delivers a clear message: act now, or it will be too late.

3. [Traditional air conditioners and refrigerants contain fluorinated gasses that can leak, deplete the ozone layer and harm the environment](https://eia-international.org/climate/sustainable-cooling-technologies/). Sustainable cooling targets efficiency improvements to cooling solutions alongside measures that lower ambient temperatures in buildings and urban environments. [2022 was the hottest year on record](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130237), and as the atmosphere warms, heatwaves, soaring temperatures, droughts and other weather extremes are becoming more frequent and more intense. [Sustainable cooling can help tackle the climate crisis](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-sustainable-cooling-and-how-can-it-help-tackle-the-climate-crisis/). 

4. [COP28 presidency launches bid called 'International Youth Climate Delegate Program' to put climate vulnerable youth at the center of climate talks](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/cop28-launches-program-to-put-marginalised-youth-at-the-centre-of-climate-talks/), stating: 'We may not know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future. It is you - our young people.' The objectives of the program include ensuring that youth views and proposals are fully integrated into global climate policymaking and dialogues; building youth skills, capacity, knowledge and networks, particularly in the most impacted countries, to engage in climate processes and providing a model for the COP process on youth inclusion. [People between 18 and 35, who demonstrate a commitment to climate issues and ideally have experience in the area, can apply to participate in the program until the 7th of April](https://www.cop28.com/en/youth-program).

**Oceans**
1. [Investor coalition to engage seafood sector on key nature risks](https://sustainablebrands.com/read/finance-investment/investor-coalition-engage-seafood-sector-key-nature-risks). New [WWF research](https://www.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Seafood-AM-Report.pdf) shows some banks and investors recognize the potential for environmental, social and governance risks in seafood but most lack robust or actionable policies, as fewer than 5% acknowledge having a process to identify the impacts of their financing activities on nature.

2. [The Global Fund for Coral Reefs](https://globalfundcoralreefs.org/) is a 10-year, $625 million coalition between UN agencies, financial institutions and private philanthropy sources, which supports [business models that can sustainably finance key conservation and development goals for coral reefs via two initiative funds](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/welcoming-the-global-fund-for-coral-reefs-to-the-race-to-resilience/); the grant fund, which provides technical assistance, capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, and the investment fund that generates de-risked investment capital to maximize the impact of projects incubated by the grant fund. 

3. [Why the High Seas Treaty is a breakthrough for the ocean and the planet](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/why-the-high-seas-treaty-is-a-breakthrough-for-the-ocean-and-the-planet/). The High Seas Treaty includes an agreement to impose strict protection of the ocean outside national borders and rules for the sustainable use of its resources, to ensure that we are not depleting ocean ecosystems and stipulates that environmental impact assessments must be completed before any new exploitation of marine resources in areas beyond national jurisdictions, and features provisions to allow for equitable sharing of knowledge, technologies and benefits from marine genetic resources. 

4. [Where is your squid coming from? Most likely unregulated waters, according to a new international study](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/where-squid-coming-likely-unregulated-waters-new-study/). Scientists and policymakers have voiced growing concerns about the decline of global squid stocks, but [little has been done to date to target squid fishing activities that are expanding into unregulated species](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8125). Using satellite imagery, vessel tracking and data monitoring, the study found that the fishing conducted by the globalized light-luring squid fishery was extensive, fishing between 149,000 and 151,000 vessel days annually, and that effort increased 68% over the study period from 2017 - 2020.

5. A [new Horizon EU project aims to identify the locations within the European seas where marine protected areas would protect the highest number of species, habitats and ecosystems](https://www.obis.org/2023/03/10/MPA_europe/). This information will support stakeholders involved in marine spatial planning in establishing effective conservation areas. 

**New platforms and initiatives**

1. GEO BON is developing an online platform, 'Bon in a Box' ([introduced with a short (3 minute) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLjnjCWwU3w)) that will help countries assess the information they have and guide monitoring to improve knowledge of the trends in biodiversity. There is a [one question questionnaire to assess interest of potential users and contributors](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexJu0obGMgMXZYyN4UNgw7LPTsrjhklogvk8YSgW2Mk5DoHg/viewform). 

2. The European Commission adopted the [Euratom Work Programme 2023 - 2025 ](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/57d8f069-9d63-4c55-a56d-53b4b9fad04b_en) implementing the [Euratom Research and Training Programme and supporting nuclear researchers with ‚Ç¨132 million](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/researchers-receive-eu132-million-through-new-euratom-research-and-training-work-programme-2023-2025-2023-03-17_en) in funding. This [call for proposals will focus on the safety of Small Modular Reactors, development of nuclear materials and the secure management and disposal of radioactive waste](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,0;statusCodes=31094501;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=43298916;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState). 

3. [Planet's satellite data will be leveraged to enhance a unique monitoring solution for the defense and intelligence sector](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-and-preligens-partner-to-achieve-near-persistent-monitoring-for-defense-intelligence-analysts/), solving a critically needed data processing gap, accelerating the intelligence cycle and increasing overall situational awareness.

4. The [2023 UN Small Island Developing States Partnerships Awards are now accepting applications](https://sdgs.un.org/SIDSPartnershipsAwards) from all stakeholders. The deadline for applications is on the 28th of April, and the laureates of the Awards will be invited to New York in July 2023 at the Awards ceremony. 

5. The Joint Research Centre through he BIOPAMA program launched a [Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) focused on 'Assessing tourism services in protected areas: value chain and economic analyses'](https://mooc-conservation.org/courses/course-v1:mooc-conservation+01+2022/about), aiming to enable park managers, nature conservation agencies and other stakeholders to improve their capacity in assessing the tourism activities related to their protected areas and their economic and financial impacts. 

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Generative AI and the unceasing acceleration of academic writing](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/03/14/generative-ai-and-the-unceasing-acceleration-of-academic-writing/). The launch of ChatGPT has galvanized a debate around how it could or should be used in research and teaching. Mark Carrigan argues that the dynamic of ChatGPT and generative AIs as efficiency tools opens the door to further growth and acceleration in research outputs, but also raises questions about the value of these products of academic labour. For example, Science and Springer Nature have prohibited that ChatGPT was credited as a co-author on papers. Science's editor-in-chief argued that text produced by Chat-GPT would be seen as plagiarism whereas Nature has allowed their use under specific documented circumstances.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1.  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was opened for the world's governments for signature 50 years ago, on 3 March, 1973. Since then, its membership grew from 10 to 184 Parties, who [work together to ensure that animals and plants will not go extinct in the wild by regulating international wildlife trade, thereby guaranteeing that it is legal, sustainable and traceable](https://cites.org/eng/news/celebrating-50-years-of-cites). Roughly 3 months after the CoP19 in Panama City, [hundreds of species are accorded new regulatory measures](https://cites.org/eng/news/new-cites-trade-rules-come-into-effect). There are now [almost 40,000 species listed and therefore regulated under the Convention](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/celebrating-partnerships-for-conservation), ranging from elephants, crocodiles and tigers, to corals, caviar, orchids and high-value timbers. 10 Years ago on the 3rd of March, was the first World Wildlife Day, and this year on that date, the [legislation to create a U.S. Foundation for International Conservation, that would fund public-private partnerships designed to support large-scale conservation and effective protected area management around the world](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-statement-on-legislation-to-create-a-u-s-foundation-for-international-conservation) while also benefiting local communities, was reintroduced. 

2. To eliminate overfishing, illegality and habitat conversion from seafood value chains, a new collaboration of five conservation and biodiversity-focused organizations launched [an initiative that will leverage the power of investors to engage seafood companies on critical nature and biodiversity related impacts and risks](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-investor-collaboration-will-engage-the-seafood-sector-on-key-nature-risks-and-impacts).

3. To [safeguard tropical Africa's iconic species, let's preserve their close relationship with local communities](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2527). Over time, rainforest communities in Africa have developed a close relationship with umbrella species (iconic and/or threatened species, whose conservation also protects a wide range of flora and fauna that occur in the same habitat), such as great apes and elephants. This relationship is expressed in various cultural practices that are passed down from generation to generation. Several African governments are considering the inclusion of these practices and beliefs in the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage.

4. [Review reveals how biodiversity data supports research on human diseases](https://www.gbif.org/news/11OGVaJcueG829KraUfezA/review-reveals-how-biodiversity-data-supports-research-on-human-diseases), highlighting the possible benefits of better coordination on data sharing around global disease surveillance. 

**Climate**
1. To limit global warming, [ocean-based solutions have the potential to reduce the emissions-gap by up to 21%](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/gigawatt-dreams-to-reality-realizing-the-potential-of-offshore-wind-to-avert-a-climate-crisis/) by 2050: Coastal ecosystems can sequester large amounts of carbon, aquatic food production can provide low-carbon protein to the worlds' growing population, and offshore wind energy, which has the potential to provide more than enough energy to power the world four times over.

2. There is [no Paris Agreement without protecting, restoring, sustaining and managing nature, and this cannot be done without Indigenous Peoples, youth and finance](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/razan-al-mubarak-there-is-no-paris-agreement-without-protecting-restoring-sustaining-and-managing-nature/). 

**Oceans**
1. [Avoiding greenwashing and defining emission reductions: how a science-based framework could catalyse maritime's Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/avoiding-greenwashing-and-defining-emission-reductions/). More than 80% of global trade by volume is carried by sea, but only ~3% of global greenhouse gas emissions is contributed by this sector. In an interview with Jean-Marc Bonello the impact of a science-based framework on the Race to Zero is explained.

2. The [Copernicus Marine Service has implemented a significant upgrade to its main physical analysis and forecasting system](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/update-ocean-model-copernicus-marine). The improvements include better tracking of pollution, trade and marine navigation (better ship routing), polar environment monitoring (more accurate provision of sea ice conditions), better characterization of oceanic resources, better characterization of oceanic extremes and Marine Heat Waves.

3. [Schmidt Ocean Institute launches a new research vessel that will change the face of ocean exploration](https://oceandecade.org/news/soi-new-research-vessel-change-ocean-exploration/), bringing together breakthrough technology (including a 105 m2 main laboratory, a 150-ton crane, 2 moonpools, equipment for high-resolution ocean depth mapping) and the global marine science community. 

4. [Germany becomes the newest member of the Ocean Decade Alliance](https://oceandecade.org/news/germany-joins-the-ocean-decade-alliance/), bolstering its commitment to the UN Decade of Ocean for Sustainable Development. The Ocean Decade Alliance will support all forms of ocean science to successfully deliver the Ocean Decade's vision and thus contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

5. The world's leading art and design university, [the Royal College of Art, has been named a UN Ocean Decade Implementing Partner](https://oceandecade.org/news/royal-college-of-art-new-decade-implementing-partner/). The RCA will focus on tackling three of the challenges identified by the Ocean Decade: protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy, and change humanity's relationship with the ocean by generating measurable, sustainable and human-centred impact on the health of the ocean.  

6. A [key component of marine ecosystems, zooplankton, is changing together with our climate](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=447:a-key-component-of-marine-ecosystems-is-changing-together-with-our-climate&catid=13&Itemid=125). A new paper shows how various species are affected, and highlights that coordinated, sustained ocean observations will be essential to understand how ecosystems will continue to function in our changing environment.

7. [UN delegates reach history agreement on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134157): a text to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction has been finalized after nearly two decades of talks.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. 15 Small Grants Fund recipients, who are funded by the Global Forest Watch, across Central and South America, Africa and Southeast Asia are going to use [satellite-based forest monitoring technologies to raise awareness to build capacity to manage and protect forests and improve forest governance](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/people/2023-global-forest-watch-small-grants-fund-recipients/). Satellite imagery will be used to identify recent forest disturbances, which is crucial to stop deforestation.

2. [DataCite launches Global Access Program with support from CZI](https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-launches-global-access-program-with-support-from-czi/) (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), which is based on increasing community awareness, supporting and developing infrastructure and lowering financial barriers to access.  

3. A new method was developed to use [deep learning and natural language processing to extract mentions of risk factors of food insecurity from text](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/predicting-food-crisis-outbreaks-using-natural-language-processing-news-streams) of more than 11 million news articles about food-insecure countries published between 1980 and 2020. Almost 170 relevant keywords and phrases were discovered (such as 'drought', 'raising food prices' and 'pests'. Risk indicators of food insecurity were developed based on the occurrence of these keywords in news articles. A machine learning model has been developed that incorporates these news indicators to generate monthly district-level predictions. These predictions can be used to prioritize the allocation of emergency food assistance.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [OpenAIRE Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/) is an open resource that aggregates a collection of research data properties within the OpenAIRE Open Science infrastructure. The Graph is one of the largest and most heterogeneous collections of scholarly metadata for research products. A [roadmap with 5 future goals for the Graph was developed](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-graph-steadily-riding-the-wild-wave-of-open-science): 1) make the Graph well-developed and developer-friendly, 2) Make the Graph more interoperable, 3) Improve its coverage, 4) improve content quality and transparency and 5) make it easy to query and maintain.

2. The [results of the OpenAIRE survey 'Who is managing research data?](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-survey-who-is-managing-research-data), which has been filled out by 18 people. Based on the answers, proper research data management is being done by a wide variety of roles, often in an informal capacity. 

3. [Three reasons we should place a higher value on meta-research](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/02/23/three-reasons-we-should-place-a-higher-value-on-meta-research/) (investigating the process and norms of how knowledge is generated): it provides a high-level synthesis,  and is balanced and introspective.
