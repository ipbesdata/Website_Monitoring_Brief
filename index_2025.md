### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. Collaboration, capacity-building and conservation in East Africa: [rangers trained on monitoring the illegal killing of elephants](), a collaboration by CITES and the College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka, in the United Republic of Tanzania. This training of trainers was designed to equip rangers with the expertise to apply their knowledge in the field while also enabling them to train and mentor other rangers in their respective conservation areas. Its primary purpose was to strengthen the skills and knowledge of rangers in combating wildlife crime, with a specific emphasis on elephant mortality data collection and reporting as well as introducing them to wildlife crime scene management techniques, including the type and cause of death, detection method, age and sex of the elephant before death and the presence or absence of tusks. Participants also engaged in practical exercises to ensure they could collect this information systematically using standardised protocols and apply crime scene management techniques to preserve evidence for court proceedings.

2. IUCN launches [11 new SOS Lemur Phase II projects](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-launches-11-new-sos-lemurs-phase-ii-projects-in-madagascar/) in Madagascar, aimed at safeguarding threatened lemur species, enhancing habitat restoration, engaging with local communities and advancing scientific research to further the understanding of these unique primates. The launch event underscored the importance of collaborative efforts in conservation, bringing together stakeholders from a wide range of sectors. SOS Lemurs Phase II is more than just a conservation initiative; it aims to foster long-term, sustainable solutions for both lemurs and the people living alongside them. By integrating socio-economic development with conservation efforts, the initiative is designed to provide local communities with sustainable livelihoods, ensuring that the conservation of lemurs also benefits the human populations who share their environment. As Madagascar faces mounting challenges like deforestation, climate change, and habitat fragmentation, the work of initiatives such as SOS Lemurs remains vital in securing a future for these remarkable primates.

3. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have major goals to restore their degraded landscapes. Forest loss has been a decades-long problem, with the region losing nearly 15 million hectares of trees (1.2% of the total) from 2015 to 2023. However, recognizing the importance of forests for both people and nature, 18 countries have committed to protect and restore over 50 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030 as part of [Initiative 20x20](https://initiative20x20.org/). With five years left to achieve the goal, how are countries doing? For the first time, with new satellite data, it is possible to show where trees are growing, where they remain standing, and where they're disappearing. The [data shows that while Latin America overall lost more tree cover than it gained from 2015 to 2023, progress is being made compared to historical trends](https://www.wri.org/insights/tree-cover-declining-latin-america-new-data-shows-where-increasing). Among the 18 countries participating in Initiative 20x20, three countries gained tree cover from 2015 to 2023, 10 remained neutral and five experienced losses. Using this data, national and local governments can better identify successful programs or where change is needed.

4. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) [launched](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-UK-aim4nature-to-ecosystem-restoration/en) Accelerating Innovative Monitoring for Nature Restoration ([AIM4NatuRe](https://www.fao.org/ecosystem-restoration-monitoring/aim4natuRe/en)), a new initiative with GBP 7 million from the United Kingdom to improve monitoring and reporting of global ecosystem restoration efforts. Countries will receive support to build capacity and use the latest technology to monitor and report their progress towards target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), which aims to restore at least 30 percent of degraded ecosystems by 2030. To ensure seamless data sharing and analysis, AIM4NatuRe will prioritize data interoperability. This will involve establishing standardized data formats and protocols that facilitate the harmonization and aggregation of data collected at national levels into a global reporting framework. This will enhance transparency and comparability while reducing the reporting burden for countries. AIM4NatuRe will also develop practical guidance documents and technical solutions, namely the Framework for Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring (FERM), to support countries in data collection, analysis, and reporting, ensuring that information is readily available and usable. Notably, the initiative will support Indigenous Peoples in the monitoring of biocentric nature restoration, a holistic approach that prioritizes the well-being of all living things within an ecosystem. A pilot with FAO's Indigenous Peoples unit will take place in Brazil and Peru.

5. Efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing have received a boost from the People's Republic of China, the world’s largest capture fisheries producer, which has become the [108th State to join the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA)](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/boostfor-the-global-fight-against-illegalunreported-and-unregulated-fishing/en). The PSMA supports sustainable fisheries by ensuring that only legal, regulated and reported fish catches are landed in ports and eventually traded. It does this by enabling Parties to deny port entry or use of port to foreign vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing, thereby preventing catches from such illicit practices from reaching markets and consumers. They reveal for example that more than 40 percent of all taxa surveyed are no longer present in at least one of the areas where they were previously cultivated or occurred naturally, while about one-third of tree species are threatened. 

6. Genetic diversity is key to creating more resilient agrifood systems that withstand challenges such as shifting climate patterns. Since 80 percent of the food we consume is plant-based, preserving a wide range of genetic materials allows farmers to grow crops and varieties suited to their local environments, enhancing food security and livelihoods. As the world faces widespread hunger, malnutrition and poverty, exacerbated by biodiversity loss, climate change, land degradation, and conflicts, there is an urgent need to halt the loss of the genetic resources that support agrifood systems. Two [new reports](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/the-genetic-diversity-of-our-plants-and-forests-is-at-risk--new-fao-reports-warn/en) emphasise the need for urgent action: the [Third report on the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd4711en) and the [Second report on the state of the world's forest genetic resources](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd4838en). Supporting genetic diversity in agriculture goes beyond protecting species and varieties. It also preserves traditional practices and cultures worldwide, including those of Indigenous Peoples, small-scale agricultural producers, and local communities. These people are the stewards of much of the world’s genetic resources and biodiversity.

7. The Data Science Network for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Biodiversity, [Redbioma](https://redbioma.org/en), has [launched](https://www.gbif.org/news/6PmnmBl0TSa0uQeXoCgrnb/redbioma-portal-to-boost-collaboration-and-capacity-in-mesoamerica) a [GBIF hosted portal](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) to advance regional efforts to foster cross-border collaboration, promote free and open access to biodiversity data and strengthen capacity in data-driven biodiversity science across Central America and Mexico. The Redbioma portal currently helps users explore more than 94 million occurrence records across 1,100-plus datasets from nearly 200 institutions. The site also enables search and discovery of regional events and training courses as well as GBIF-enabled scientific and policy publications authored or co-written by researchers based in Mesoamerican institutions. By reducing data fragmentation and promoting open science in the region, the Redbioma portal aims to enhance regional collaboration, improve access to biodiversity information and reflect Mesoamerica’s growing leadership in open data and biodiversity informatics.

**Climate**
1. The [Sports for Climate Action training courses has been launched](https://unfccc.int/news/new-training-course-aims-at-boosting-sustainability-of-sports), a step forward in the broader capacity-building programme under the UN Climate Change Sports for Climate Action Initiative. [Introduction to sports for climate action](https://unccelearn.org/course/view.php?id=214&page=overview) was designed for anyone interested in how sports and climate change intersect, and what can be done to build a more sustainable, resilient sports sector. [Sports for climate action](https://unccelearn.org/course/view.php?id=215&page=overview) was designed to support sports organisations, from local clubs to international governing bodies, in adopting and implementing sustainable practices that reduce their environmental impact. The courses were developed with the support of sportswear giant Adidas as part of its ‘Move for the Planet’ initiative, which aims to harness the power of sporting communities to promote sustainability and climate action. Through the UN Climate Change Sports for Climate Action Initiative, sports organizations can become catalysts for environmental responsibility, community engagement and global collaboration. A dedicated training series for grassroots sports NGOs is on the way, aimed at empowering local communities with the knowledge and tools they need to co-design climate solutions that reflect their realities and priorities. This upcoming initiative will further extend the reach of the Sports for Climate Action Initiative, ensuring that climate action through sport is inclusive, community-led and impactful.

2. The Santiago Network and the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage signed a [letter of intent](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frld_climateaction-santiagonetwork-frld-activity-7293689863692836864-Xk5h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAACMPo7kBsddxVv4u-57iTYuQeynXVdMDC1Y) on how to [provide support to vulnerable populations and communities facing climate-related losses](https://unfccc.int/news/a-vital-partnership-to-strengthen-support-for-vulnerable-communities). The letter signals a commitment to operationalise guidance from COP28 to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and intense storms, droughts and wildfires.

**Oceans**
1. As one of the world’s megadiverse countries, Brazil has a crucial role in biodiversity data collection in all realms. After a short interruption due to internal reorganization, the OBIS Brazil Node is [back in operation](https://www.obis.org/2025/04/23/brazil-rejoins-obis/). Hosted by the SiBBr, the Brazilian Biodiversity Information System, the renewed OBIS Node aims to improve marine biodiversity data coverage in the region, focusing, among other things, on gap-filling and the possibility of integrating local and Indigenous knowledge into available datasets. Eventually, beyond improving scientific knowledge, Brazil’s ambitions are to reinforce its role and strengthen its position as a substantial biodiversity data contributor on the global stage. 

2. [The offshore oil boom is fueling a climate crisis at sea](https://globalfishingwatch.org/news-story/the-offshore-oil-boom-is-fueling-a-climate-crisis-at-sea/), has been revealed in a new report, [Exposing the environmental costs of offshore oil: greenhouse gas emissions, oil slicks, and flaring](https://skytruth.org/section/environmental-costs-offshore-oil/) from environmental watchdog SkyTruth. The report offers the most comprehensive dataset to date on offshore oil infrastructure and its findings come at a time when nearly three-quarters of new oil production is taking place offshore, often beyond the reach of effective regulation. Drawing on more than a year's worth of satellite imagery, the analysis exposes extensive and recurring oil spills, methane flaring and greenhouse gas emissions from both conventional platforms and increasingly common floating production and storage vessels, raising the alarm about the growing environmental toll of the offshore oil and gas industry and its long-term impacts on the climate. The report also spotlights the uneven impact of pollution on the marine ecosystems and communities of low- and middle-income coastal countries. West Africa, a region where the most polluting offshore oil and gas infrastructure is concentrated, is prominently featured in the report with five of the top ten most polluting sites detected in Nigeria. Other countries featured among those most impacted by offshore pollution include Angola, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Norway. 

3. [Keeping connected: submarine communications cables and ocean life](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/keeping-connected-submarine-communications-cables-and-ocean-life). They carry almost all of the world’s intercontinental internet traffic and play a fundamental role in the global economy as well as enabling everyday activities such as emails, video calls, live streaming and personal messaging services. The global submarine cable network spans over 1.7 million kilometres, crossing national boundaries and continents, from the shallow seas to the deep ocean with demand for its capacity continuing to grow. Given the rapid expansion of the submarine cable network, it is crucial to consider its impact on marine biodiversity.  To address this, UNEP-WCMC worked with the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) to assess the potential impacts of installing, operating and removing submarine cables, while exploring strategies to mitigate any negative impacts in the future. The findings are now available in a new report, '[Submarine cables and marine biodiversity]https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT691)'. Overall, the analysis found that submarine cables have a relatively small footprint in the marine environment. Globally, less than 0.01 per cent of the seafloor is within 10 metres of submarine cables. Potential pressures and resultant impacts from cable activities on marine biodiversity are generally local and minimal, although they do vary spatially and over the cable lifecycle. A key finding of the new report is that sensing technology, used within the submarine cable industry, presents potential benefits and opportunities as follows: Submarine cables can detect extreme weather events, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and allow for more precise monitoring of underwater eruptions and earthquakes; and fibre-optic sensing can detect the mating and feeding calls of blue, fin and baleen whales.

4. [MINKA](https://minka-sdg.org/), a [citizen science observatory](https://oceandecade.org/actions/minka-citizen-science-observatory/) created by marine scientists and conservationists from Spain, has been endorsed as Ocean Decade Action as a project within the Marine Life 2030 programme for its [significant contribution to global ocean sustainability](https://oceandecade.org/news/minka-a-species-observation-platform-documenting-biodiversity-one-photo-at-a-time/). What makes MINKA stand out is its inclusive approach to ecosystem restoration and protection. The team, which includes many women working in fields such as marine litter, taxonomy, data governance, science-based policy and resource management, is dedicated to making science accessible for all. While initially focused on marine species and EOVs, MINKA is now used to document flora and fauna, water temperature and even litter from any ecosystem. By sharing educational content, citizen science opportunities and stunning images of marine species, MINKA is inspiring individuals around the world to document species diversity in their neighborhoods.

5. A team of scientists has created a new [guide 'Introduction to developing DNA reference barcode sequences'](https://zenodo.org/records/14867763), developed by the West Coast Biomolecular Observing Network, to advance standards for collecting and cataloging DNA from marine species, enhancing a revolutionary method for monitoring ocean biodiversity. While research standards are already established across scientific fields, this guide offers diverse insights focusing on DNA barcode sequencing for marine species, compiling best practices into a single resource. DNA barcodes sequences are short, unique identifiers for each species. By standardizing methods, the guide aims to ensure the accuracy and consistency of DNA submitted to global databases like GenBank or the Barcode of Life Data System.

6. [Scuba diving with transformar transforms young people into ocean advocates](https://oceandecade.org/news/scuba-diving-with-transformar-transforms-young-people-into-ocean-advocates/). Scuba diving is expensive, making it hard to access for individuals in lower-income communities. To break this barrier, [TransforMAR](https://www.transformar.eco.br/) was founded, providing young people from low-income families with the opportunity to dive without completing a full certification course. It is more affordable, and each dive is guided by a certified instructor, ensuring both safety and accessibility for people of all abilities, and combines the dive with theoretical and practical educational activities focused on marine biology and environmental conservation, promoting environmental awareness among vulnerable youth. As youth participate in TransforMAR activities, they are encouraged to share the knowledge they gained in those experiences with their communities through their Ocean Ambassadors programme which supports incoming students as they create and carry out impactful projects. This approach amplifies youth voices as leaders in their communities and supports new youth leaders in a sustainable way to help shape a new generation of ocean advocates. 

7. Ocean science in action: what is sustainable ocean planning and why must it be rooted in science? As the demand for ocean space grows, so do the pressures and trade-offs between conservation, livelihoods, and development. The closure of some islands for coral restoration can create tensions with local tourism businesses. Plans to expand Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can clash with energy or shipping interests. When existing uses are affected by new plans or policies, concerns can emerge. [How do we turn potential conflicts into win-win solutions where both people and the ocean can thrive?](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-what-is-sustainable-ocean-planning-and-why-must-it-be-rooted-in-science/) These are the challenges and opportunities of managing the ocean sustainably: balancing economic development with the need to protect marine ecosystems. Sustainable ocean planning helps nations map out how to use their ocean space wisely, with tools like MPAs, fishing regulations, and pollution management. Four success stories highlight how the Ocean Decade is turning scientific research into solutions for more sustainable ocean policies: the global gold standard for ocean protection [Blue Parks](https://oceandecade.org/actions/blue-parks/), [swimways](https://oceandecade.org/actions/migravias-connecting-marine-protected-areas-mpas-through-ocean-swimways-to-protect-migratory-routes-and-critical-habitats-of-endangered-species/), safe wildlife corridors across the Eastern Pacific that connect MPAs, [living ocean labs](https://oceandecade.org/actions/hybrid-governance-high-seas/) for high seas protection, and [Whales and Climate](https://oceandecade.org/actions/whales-and-climate/), an international research project on understanding how climate change is reshaping the lives of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales and what that means for the ocean.

8. The onshore component of the Argentine red shrimp fishery has become the country's [first coastal shrimp fishery to achieve MSC certification](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2025/04/03/argentine-red-shrimp-fishery-achieves-msc-certification-after-decade-of-sustainability-efforts), marking a major milestone for sustainability in the region. The milestone recognises significant advancements in fishery management, environmental monitoring, and the reduction of ecological impacts. By meeting MSC’s rigorous criteria, the fishery will contribute to both the long-term abundance of the shrimp population and the protection of the surrounding marine ecosystem. Argentine red shrimp, known for its high quality and vibrant colour, has been one of the fastest-growing seafood products globally over the past 15 years. With an annual catch of approximately 72,000 metric tons, the fishery plays a crucial role in Argentina’s economy, supporting jobs in coastal communities and strengthening local industry. As global demand for certified sustainable seafood rises, Argentina’s red shrimp fishery is positioning itself as a leader in responsible fishing, benefiting both the environment and the economy.

9. The health of the climate is inseparable from the health of the Ocean. As temperatures rise, the ocean absorbs much of the excess heat. Ocean warming has major consequences, from increased stratification in the ocean, change in ocean currents and sea level rise to reduced solubility of carbon and damage to the Earth’s cryosphere. These shifts are already impacting coastal communities, fisheries, and natural habitats. Understanding this complex, dynamic system is key to predicting and preparing for what comes next. Through [investment in blue science and international collaboration](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/safeguarding-our-ocean-and-climate-through-european-innovation), the European Union is putting the Ocean at the core of its climate strategy – showcased at the [EU Digital Ocean Pavilion](https://www.digitaloceanpavilion.eu/) at UNOC3 from 2 – 13 June 2025.

10. Global sea levels have risen by 15-25 cm from 1901 to 2018, with the global rate nearly doubling in the last two decades. This rise is fuelled by melting glaciers and ice sheets, thermal expansion (as ocean water warms), and changes in terrestrial water storage. While the pace may seem gradual, the long-term impacts are becoming increasingly clear: infrastructure damages, erosions, increased coastal flooding and habitat loss. With many EU Member States hosting extensive and densely populated coastlines, [sea level rise is an urgent concern](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/rising-tides-how-europe-responding-sea-level-rise). From the low-lying Netherlands to the Mediterranean regions of Italy and Greece, the risks include coastal flooding and erosion, damage to transport, infrastructure and housing, disruption to tourism, fisheries and trade, threats to biodiversity and food security. The expected annual damage caused by coastal floods for Europe alone stands at €1.25 billion euros, with the potential to increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude if coastal adaptation measures remain at their current level. Although there is no single EU policy targeting sea level rise, several frameworks support resilience and adaptation: the EU Climate Adaptation Strategy, the EU Floods Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and the EU Ocean Pact. These policies help assess and manage risk, enhance regional preparedness, and encourage integrated planning across sectors. The European Green Deal further reinforces this work by aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, while promoting economic growth that is decoupled from resource use — tackling both causes and consequences of sea level rise.

**Pollution**
1. [Marine ecosystems are under growing pressure from pollution](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/europes-approach-mitigating-marine-pollution) – from plastics and chemicals to oil spills. These pollutants are transforming vital marine and coastal habitats into toxic zones. The impact extends beyond ecosystems: oceans regulate Earth’s climate by storing carbon and distributing heat. Oceans are absorbing the byproducts of modern life at an unsustainable rate. The European Union blends policy with technology to tackle marine pollution. From 2 to 13 June 2025, the EU Digital Ocean Pavilion at the Third United Nations Ocean Conference will showcase these efforts. On 10 June 2025, the [European Digital Ocean Pavilion](https://www.digitaloceanpavilion.eu/) at the Third United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC3) will host a morning session on marine pollution. Topics will include nutrients, plastics, heavy metals, and underwater noise – and the innovative ways Europe is addressing them.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [Predicting cholera using remote sensing data: a glimpse into the future](). Cholera remains a significant public health concern globally, with an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths annually (WHO). Remote sensing data is revolutionising the prediction of cholera outbreaks, with a number of strong examples in Africa. For instance, remote sensing data can track changes in sea surface temperature, precipitation and water quality, all of which are critical factors in cholera dynamics. One notable example is the use of satellite data to predict cholera outbreaks in coastal regions of Africa. Researchers have utilised data on sea surface temperature, air temperatures, precipitation and chlorophyll concentrations to forecast cholera outbreaks with significant accuracy.

2. Europe is taking control of its digital future. With the [launch of LLMs4Europe](https://www.openaire.eu/llms4europe-launches-europe-builds-its-own-fine-tuned-large-language-models-for-key-sectors), over 70 partners from across the continent have joined forces to build open, trustworthy, and multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to European needs. Crucially, the pilot connects to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), leveraging Europe’s open science infrastructure to access, process, and validate scientific knowledge. OpenAIRE leads efforts to mobilise trusted, multilingual content from repositories, publishers, and scholarly societies, effectively building a Data Space connector to power the fine-tuned LLM models with FAIR and verified data. It will also co-develop applications to test the factual reliability of outputs, ensuring that AI tools for science remain transparent and accountable. In addition, OpenAIRE hopes to learn from the data space architecture and governance models developed in the project, and to create synergies with AI technology providers, paving the way for new applications that combine open science and cutting-edge AI.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The second resumed session of the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP16) took place from the 25th to the 27th of February 2025 in Rome, Italy, which a focus on a series of key decisions where consensus had not been reached, related to biodiversity finance; planning, monitoring, reporting and review; and to the monitoring framework to measure progress towards the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Monitoring Framework. The following [key decisions were adopted](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/key-decisions-agreed-as-cbd-cop16-concludes-in-rome): 1. Mobilizing resources from all sources – public and private, domestic and international – to close the biodiversity finance gap, and 2. Resolving a long-unresolved issue regarding the financial mechanism of the Convention, which is aimed at operationalizing international financial flows from developed to developing countries in order to fulfil commitments under Article 20 of the Convention. 

2. This year's theme for World Wildlife Day was [Wildlife conservation finance: investing in people and planet](https://cites.org/eng/news/collaborative-partnership-on-sustainable-wildlife-management-join-statement-world-wildlife-day-2025). While public finance, overseas development assistance, and philanthropy remain fundamental funding sources, expanding traditional financing through innovative mechanisms such as payments for ecosystem services, debt-for nature swaps, biodiversity credits, sustainable biodiversity-based economic activities, green bonds, and benefit-sharing schemes is critical. Furthermore, private finance for nature has grown significantly, increasing elevenfold in just four years—from $9.4 billion to over $102 billion, as highlighted at the 3rd World Biodiversity Forum in Davos. Yet, despite this progress, a $700 billion annual funding gap persists for nature conservation. Additionally, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities continue to receive limited direct financial support.

2. In October 2024, the Protected Planet Report 2024 was launched by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN. As of March 2025, 17.54% of land and inland water areas are protected or conserved, as well as 8.45% of marine areas. A widely used approach to recognizing important spaces for nature globally is the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) standard. There are over 16,500 areas mapped within the World Database of KBAs, covering more than 22 million km2, or 4.3 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Important areas are also identified through other processes at national, regional and global scales. Prioritizing protection of KBAs and other important spaces for biodiversity can focus available resources on priority areas, including for threatened and vulnerable species and habitats. Yet the Protected Planet Report revealed that while two-thirds of KBAs are protected or conserved to some extent, almost one-third lack any form of protection at all. Conservation efforts must therefore be scaled up to prioritize these spaces. The Protected Planet Report [highlights](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/beyond-coverage-strengthening-the-quality-of-protected-and-conserved-areas) that approximately one in four ecoregions have more than 30 per cent protection, and only 8.5% of land is both connected and protected. Many ecoregions still lack adequate protection, and greater focus is needed on achieving ecological representativeness, as outlined in Target 3. Most sites are reported under the governance of national governments, with limited recognition of non-state governance. Only 3.95 per cent of the total global coverage of protected and conserved areas is reported as being governed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, 0.5 per cent is under private governance and 11.84 per cent is under shared governance. However, the Protected Planet Report estimates that when combining Indigenous and traditional territories alongside protected and conserved areas, global coverage of land and inland water areas under protected, conserved or Indigenous and traditional management is at least 31.2 per cent. 

4. Women4Biodiversity [launches Restore HER Rights Initiative](https://women4biodiversity.org/restore-her-rights-global-virtual-launch/) in Argentina, Costa Rica, Cameroon, Kenya, Myanmar and the Solomon Islands. Women4Biodiversity has been advancing gender equality in restoration processes globally since 2021. To give this engagement a bigger push, Women4Biodiversity will launch the Restore HER Rights Initiative to foster a collaborative space for learning and advocacy in gender-responsive approaches to ecosystem restoration. The Restore HER Rights Initiative aims to document community-led restoration processes while amplifying women's vital contributions to ecosystem restoration. Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo5uO_HAErzCnG5PtrQVY6DgZP8agmdt7Suq7vZMq-0cAEdQ/viewform) to become a part of this initiative.

5. UNESCO is working with Cameroon's Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife to promote [community-based sustainable tourism and conservation activities](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2743) around UNESCO World Heritage sites in Cameroon. Cameroon has two natural sites on the World Heritage List, which contain some of the most important tropical rainforests in the Congo Basin. Since 2023, UNESCO has been providing micro-grants in these protected areas to strengthen local capacity and provide direct funding for locally designed projects that benefit both people and biodiversity. In 2023–2024, UNESCO awarded nine micro-grants totalling $40,000, which helped build the capacity of 160 people including local authorities and community members, the majority of whom were women. This initiative provided hands-on training and experiential learning in project and business management, arts and crafts, local production of medicinal soap, mapping tourism potential, and the transfer of knowledge from elders to the younger generations on the cultures, traditions and interaction of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with the environment, among others. This exchange is essential, as traditions, Indigenous and local knowledge play a key role in promoting practices that enhance environmental stewardship. Building on this success, a second phase of the micro-grants programme was launched in December 2024 with a workshop to train participants in project management, and a total of 12 new local initiatives were selected for funding. These projects will support snail farming as an alternative source of protein, sustainable wild yam and honey harvesting by the Indigenous Baka people, and the organisation of traditional dances and ritual groups to promote community-based tourism, among others.

6. Global trade plays a crucial role in shaping economies. While it has provided opportunities and better income for some, these benefits are unevenly distributed, with consumption regions in the Global North benefiting the most.  In addition, these benefits have often been achieved at the cost of negative impacts on ecosystems and human well-being. As a result – in many cases – Indigenous Peoples, local communities, farmers, and rural workers have lost access to vital ecosystem services and faced social conflicts that undermine their overall well-being. Some questions arise: if you benefit from a natural resource or a commodity, should you also take responsibility for its impact? The answer is increasingly clear: yes. Business operations can impact human well-being in several ways. Expanding mining activities or commodity production, for example, can displace Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their ancestral lands and territories. [Truly addressing the social impacts at extraction sites](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-to-safeguard-human-wellbeing-across-supply-chains) and across production supply chains requires factoring in broader dimensions of human well-being to business operations and project planning.

7. Every fall, one of the planet’s most extraordinary natural spectacles occurs amid the fir forests of central Mexico: Millions of monarch butterflies land here to find respite from the cooling winter temperatures in northeastern U.S. and Canada for their annual hibernation. This incredible event, a critical part of the monarchs’ life cycle, depends on Mexico’s forests. However, these forests are feeling the effects of global climate change. One of the effects is the rise of pests; a problem that is not unique to Mexico, forest pests are a growing threat in many other countries (for example, in 2024, WRI reported that forest pests are a growing threat to Europe’s forests). The Neovolcanic Axis Conservation Fund (FOCEN) and the technical monitoring partner Ambiomas Acciones y Respuestas Adaptativas (Ambiomas), with support from GFW and the Monarch Butterfly Fund, took a [multi-pronged approach to creating the early warning system](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/monitoring-forest-pests-mexico/). Realizing the time commitment of ground patrols and the limitations of satellite imagery, they incorporated multispectral drone technology that can capture data in multiple wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) to complement field visits and provide high-resolution imagery of forest degradation that satellites cannot always capture. Thanks to the early warning system, FOCEN, Ambiomas and communities have been able to take targeted action in controlling bark beetles — namely, removing infected trees and wood debris, in accordance with Mexican regulations for controlling and preventing beetle outbreaks. More monitoring is needed to determine whether the bark beetles are now contained, and local communities are currently conducting pest and forest disease monitoring surveys as part of FOCEN’s Best Management Practices Programs within their payment for ecosystem services program.

8. [A symphony for nature: the BES-Net regional trialogue for East and Southern Africa uniting science policy and practice](https://www.besnet.world/a-symphony-for-nature-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-east-and-southern-africa-uniting-science-policy-and-practice/), where biodiversity loss, invasive alien speciesand unsustainable use of wildlife are playingout like discordant notes. These challenges don’t exist in isolation; they are deeply intertwined with water, food, health and climate change. When invasive alien  species spread unchecked, they disrupt ecosystems, strain freshwater supplies, threaten agriculture, affect human health and destabilize local livelihoods. But what if we could harmonize solutions rather than tackling these crises in silos? The series of groundbreaking assessments produced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) on the sustainable use of wild species (2022), IAS (2023) and nexus among biodiversity, water, food and health (2024) shed a critical spotlight on the profound interlinkages of these thematic issues. Equally encouraging is the presence of many communities already nurturing this balance for generations, relying on wildlife for food, income and cultural traditions. Guided by global evidence and inspired by local wisdom, the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network (BES-Net) brought together 70 experts, policymakers, Indigenous leaders and practitioners from Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe for a three-day Trialogue in Windhoek, Namibia to transform global knowledge into local action. The Trialogue also explored the theme of sustainable use of wildlife through a mix of panel discussions, interactive sessions and case studies. Country teams shared their experiences, uncovering governance models that work, gaps that persist and opportunities to scale up local successes. The role of Indigenous and local knowledge was front and centre, reinforcing the need for policies that weave diverse ways of knowing. 

9. [Forests, food and frequent satellite data for International Day of Forests 2025](https://www.planet.com/pulse/forests-food-and-frequent-satellite-data-for-international-day-of-forests-2025/). The pressing question is: How do we use technology to efficiently protect our forests from bushfires, wildlife poaching, unauthorized land conversions, and other illicit activities? [Forest health monitoring using satellite data](https://www.planet.com/industries/forestry/) offers a powerful, proactive, and practical approach, enabling governments and conservation organizations to effectively protect these invaluable resources. Planet satellite imagery and analytics can be used to spot early signs of deforestation before they escalate; track global deforestation trends and understand their impact; accurately measure forest cover loss with high-frequency imagery; strengthen bushfire response strategies using near-daily data; monitor wildlife populations to prevent poaching and habitat loss; manage reforestation projects remotely with updated insights; and estimate forest carbon levels to support carbon offset projects.

10. Without nature, businesses across the globe would be unable to operate. The production of goods, from electric cars to chocolate, relies on natural resources and ecosystem services, such as precious minerals and agricultural commodities like cocoa. Actions to improve the sustainability of business activities are most effective when embedded across the entire business. UNEP-WCMC's [Proteus Partnership](https://www.proteuspartners.org/) highlights that [every job is a nature job](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/every-job-is-nature-job-how-companies-can-protect-nature-and-build-resilience) and is developing a series of guides that enable different business functions to integrate nature into their decision-making. They provide companies with practical guidance on how business can empower nature-driven decision-making today, to build a resilient economy for tomorrow. Business and biodiversity are interconnected. Degraded ecosystems will struggle to provide the services on which the economy depends, such as food production or extraction of critical minerals for renewable technologies. Without these, supply chains will lose resilience as production is threatened by biodiversity risk. The [procurement brief](https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT567) outlines the steps professionals with this function can take to support nature. Individuals working in a business's procurement department deal with the buying of goods and services for production. The brief provides these professionals with guidance on how they can consider nature when deciding on what to purchase. Actions in the guide range from ensuring contracting processes include nature-related criteria, to understanding industry standards. Guidance is provided on how business developers can engage with specialists and stakeholders to guarantee nature-related risks are considered and mitigated, and how to ensure the consideration of nature is incorporated throughout the final decision-making process.

1. [Building climate expertise: fellowship programme empowers professionals from SIDS and LDCs](https://unfccc.int/news/building-climate-expertise-fellowship-programme-empowers-professionals-from-sids-and-ldcs) with hands-on experience and specialised training. Thanks to new funding from Portugal and Italy, more professionals can now contribute to global climate action while enhancing their expertise. Portugal’s funding specifically supports professionals from Portuguese-speaking SIDS and LDCs to work in the secretariat's Transparency Division, while Italy’s contribution funds fellowship opportunities in the Means of Implementation and Adaptation divisions. The initiative serves three core purposes: support innovative and analytical work on climate change within the framework of sustainable development; build a global network of creative experts tackling climate issues; and nurture the leadership potential of promising professionals in their respective fields.

2. Within 25 years, 3.3 million who live in the Arctic will lose their homes due to melting permafrost. As the Arctic heats at four times the global rate, this frozen ecosystem thaws, reshaping the landscape. Those who have lived on permafrost for generations now grapple with relocation as the ground sinks beneath them. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway synthesizes vast data on the location, condition, and extent of permafrost into digestible visualizations and analyses available to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. This [solution-oriented synthesis approach](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/collective-action-changing-arctic) is how NCEAS makes an immediate impact on communities affected by thawing permafrost. Engineering firms, for example, can use this information to decide where to safely relocate villages, and communities can use it to understand how much time they may have before they need to move. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway will not only help Alaskan villages adapt to a changing landscape but also inform international climate policy. This work makes permafrost change more prevalent in the consciousness of those working on climate issues, and in doing so, motivates action to halt further loss of this critical and underappreciated ecosystem.

3. Climate change has caused temperatures in the Kyrgyz Republic to rise at twice the global average, exacerbating [water stress and the risk of natural disasters](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/climate-change-reshaping-kyrgyz-republic-finds-new-unep-atlas), according to a new Atlas of Environmental Change launched today by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The average annual temperature in the country has increased by 1.2°C between 1960 and 2023— compared to a global average of 0.6°C. This rise is expected to speed up in the coming decades. Warmer temperatures mean that river flows are projected to decrease while demand for water increases. The Atlas data underlines the urgent need for strong climate adaptation policies to reduce irrigation losses, strengthen early warning systems, as well as to improve pasture management —70% of pastures in the country are estimated to be degraded. Climate change is furthermore increasing the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. On average, 200 emergencies are registered in the country each year, 90% of which are of a natural origin, such as flooding, earthquakes, mudslides, rockfalls and avalanches. In 2022, natural disasters resulted in nearly 150 people losing their lives and triggered annual average economic losses of $27 million between 2012-2018. Even as it faces these challenges, the country has made significant strides in environmental conservation, particularly in protecting its forests and wildlife. Since 2000, forest cover has increased from 6.2% to 6.9% of the Kyrgyz Republic due to afforestation, a difficult task in a country that is overwhelmingly mountainous. In 2000, protected areas made up only 0.5 million hectares of the country, but this increased to 1.5 million hectares by 2023. By 2040, protected areas are planned to cover as much as 10% of the country and protect 60–65% of the species included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. All forests in the country are legally protected from large-scale commercial logging and — thanks to the establishment of the Khan Teniri Nature Park — the area of protected land that is home to snow leopards in the Central Tien Shan mountains has been expanded by 40%. 

4. In Kochi, a major port on India's western coast, a dense network of rivers, creeks and canals was once the lifeline of the city. The waterways were a transport route for people and goods, provided water for daily use, and drained monsoon stormwaters into the sea. But many have been neglected in recent decades amid rapid urbanization, some unplanned. Buildings and bridges have encroached on the waterways, obstructing the flow. Untreated waste has polluted the increasingly stagnant waters. And invasive plants and mosquitos have replaced once-abundant fish and birds. Climate change is only adding to the problems: sea-level rise, extreme rainfall events and tidal surges have increased the risk of major flooding in the city, which is home to about 600,000 people. But a new effort by Kochi’s local authorities, supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is now underway to [restore the city’s waterways, which are seen as crucial to helping the city adapt to the changing climate](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/historic-canals-take-centre-stage-kochi-india-aims-blunt-fallout-climate). The project, which has already got residents dreaming of canals clean enough for swimming, is part of UNEP’s Generation Restoration Cities initiative to advance nature-based solutions to urgent environmental challenges in urban areas around the world.  

**Oceans**
1. The MSC has introduced a series of changes to its objections process, which came into effect at the end of February, for a pilot of 12 months, in response to feedback from different stakeholder groups and following a review of the MSC Assurance System. The [objections process](https://www.msc.org/what-you-can-do/engage-with-a-fishery-assessment/msc-objections-procedure-what-you-need-to-know) provides a route for stakeholders to challenge the outcome of a fishery assessment if they believe the independent assessor did not follow procedures correctly. Revisions are expected to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure objections can be resolved without immediate escalation to an adjudication hearing. The revisions will also align the process with those of other leading sustainability certification schemes. The MSC continues to welcome input in the [development of its Standards](https://www.msc.org/standards-and-certification/developing-our-standards) and encourages stakeholders to submit feedback and participate in formal reviews. There are also [multiple mechanisms which enable stakeholders to raise concerns](https://www.msc.org/complaints) about the conduct of a certificate holder, certification body, or the MSC itself.

2. The [Allen Coral Atlas will be funded for 2025 by two key organisations: the Anthropocene Institute and Global Conservation](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/global-conservation-and-anthropocene-institute-support-allen-coral-atlas-for-2025/). The Anthropocene Institute works towards the goals to make Earth abundant and sustainable for generations to come. Global Conservation trains, equips, and empowers people globally to advance their protection of wild spaces on land and in the sea. Combined, Anthropocene Institute and Global Conservation are providing critically needed resources to operate the Allen Coral Atlas this year. 

3. [Into the Deep: help decode ocean mysteries from your laptop](https://oceandecade.org/news/into-the-deep-help-decode-ocean-mysteries-from-your-laptop/). [Into the Deep is an online learning and citizen science platform](https://www.thedeepproject.eu/#) that invites participants, or citizen scientists, from around the world and with any level of science experience, to contribute to marine image analyses that feed into ongoing research projects. The platform hosts learning modules and a tailored participatory science tool around four distinct deep-sea marine habitats and the impact humans have had on them. By analyzing photos and identifying sea life, substrate, fish species and more, participants become empowered citizen scientists and contribute to the science we need for the ocean we want. Participants use a new web-based image analysis tool, known as BiiGLE PARTY, to make species observations in seafloor images. Results from the project show that users’ observations successfully feed into ongoing scientific research by ‘teaching’ machine learning tools to observe specific indicators amongst the thousands of images now collected by marine cruises and stationery marine observation modules. While contributing to science research, users gain a deeper understanding of marine conservation policy and agency through their participation. Marine scientists also gain a new understanding of how to communicate their research goals to the communities around them and understand the potential value of citizens as a resource. The outputs have also started to encourage more collaborations to protect our valuable marine ecosystems.

4. The identification and official registration of a new species can take up to 13.5 years—meaning some species may go extinct before they are even documented. To address this, The Nippon Foundation and Nekton jointly launched the Ocean Census in April 2023 to transform species discovery, accelerating the identification of marine life to close critical knowledge gaps before it’s too late. On the 10th of March 2025, The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, the world’s largest collaborative effort to accelerate the discovery of marine life, [announced the discovery of 866 new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/the-ocean-census-discovers-over-800-new-marine-species/), including new species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, sponge, shrimp, crab, reef fish, squat lobster, pipehorse, limpet, hooded shrimp, sea spiders and brittle stars: a significant step in advancing our understanding of ocean biodiversity, with discoveries expected to grow as the programme continues. 

5. [Navigate with Care: Protect Our Oceans](https://ifan-maritime.org/navigate-with-care/). The International Foundation for Aids to Navigation and the Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation are joining forces to [promote safer, more sustainable boating](https://oceandecade.org/news/partnering-to-promote-safe-and-sustainable-boating/). Every year, vessels around the world inadvertently damage fragile marine ecosystems, often due to a lack of awareness or inadequate navigational planning. Groundings, propeller scarring, and improper anchoring harm coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds. The campaign will provide mariners with practical resources, including guidelines for safe navigation, educational materials and tips for avoiding sensitive marine areas.

6. [Ocean science in action: building a sustainable future for coastal cities](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-building-a-sustainable-future-for-coastal-cities/). Coastal cities are booming: over a third of the world’s population now lives within 100km of the sea. However, this expansion brings mounting challenges, from climate change-induced risks to human-driven environmental degradation. Ensuring these urban centers remain resilient while preserving marine ecosystems is a pressing global priority. Urban runoff, wastewater, and poorly planned development are reshaping coasts around the world — eroding wetlands, polluting seas, and contributing to ocean warming and acidification. As a result, only 15% of the world’s coastlines remain in their natural state. 3 Initiatives endorsed by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 are pioneering innovative solutions through science, technology, policy and community action. 1. Reviving Sydney Harbour: transforming urban seascape. The [World Harbour Seascape Restoration Programme](https://oceandecade.org/actions/world-harbour-seascape-restoration-programme/), led by the Sydney Institute of Marine Science, is working to restore this fractured marine ecosystem, proving that even in the most urbanized waters, marine life can make a comeback. Its [Project Restore](https://projectrestore.sims.org.au/) breaks away from traditional, one-habitat-at-a-time restoration to revive entire marine landscapes – bringing seagrasses, kelp forests, and reefs back to life as interconnected ecosystems. In a historic first, 3,000 shoots of the endangered *Posidonia australis* seagrass have been carefully transplanted into Sydney Harbour, laying the foundation for lush underwater meadows. In parallel, 16 tonnes of sea urchins have been removed from two sites where rocky reefs once flourished to allow Ecklonia radiata kelp forests to reclaim their rightful space. 2. Predicting and preventing pollution in port areas in Quebec and beyond, where artificial intelligence is used in preventing pollution spikes. Through the [Enviro-Actions Project](https://oceandecade.org/actions/preventive-management-of-industrial-port-zones-enviro-actions/), led by the Northern Institute for Research in Environment and Occupational Health and Safety, autonomous scientific buoys (floating sensors) and monitoring stations are tracking critical water and air quality data in near real-time. But this technology doesn’t just collect data, it then acts on it: when pollution levels rise, preventive alerts are issued to halt further contamination. The Project also measures underwater noise levels and analyzes long-term environmental trends to reveal the true impact of port operations. Enviro-Actions is not just a local initiative – it is currently being deployed to other coastal regions in Quebec such as at Saguenay, and it has the potential to be implemented in all industrial or port areas on the planet, setting a new standard for sustainable maritime operations. 3. Preparing for sea-level rise in coastal cities. Coastal communities are facing the alarming reality of sea-level rise, with some areas experiencing rates up to four times faster than the global average. Cities like Jakarta, Lagos, Houston, Rotterdam, and Venice could be submerged by the end of the century unless significant adaptive measures are taken. Led by the Ocean & Climate Platform, the [Sea’ties initiative](https://oceandecade.org/actions/seaties-sharing-solutions-with-coastal-cities-to-tackle-sea-level-rise/) is empowering coastal cities to tackle the challenges of sea-level rise head-on. It brought together over 280 stakeholders, from urban planners to scientists and elected officials, to create a global network focused on sharing challenges and leading practices of adaptation solutions. This grassroot approach led the foundation to the international advocacy and mobilisation the project conducted. One key achievement of the initiative is the Sea’ties Declaration, which has rallied more than 70 mayors and city networks around four priority themes: mobilizing science and observation systems for adaptation; integrating societal issues with adaptation plans; fostering adaptive and hybrid solutions; and boosting public funding and private investments.

7. In January 2025, over 400 observers across 36 countries witnessed one of the most extraordinary natural events: the synchronised spawning of *Porites rus*, a key tropical, reef-building coral which has been known to spawn in a predictable and synchronised manner in certain regions. After the discovery of the synchronised spawning in 2020, [Tama no te Tairoto](https://tamanotetairoto.org/) (children of the lagoon) worked to track these events across 18 islands, collecting 426 observations which confirmed the synchronisation  from French Polynesia to La Réunion Island, which lead to a fundamental question about reef connectivity: can coral species synchronize their reproduction on a global scale? Therefore, observers registered from 36 countries and territories, spanning from Costa Rica to the Red Sea, including regions like Fiji, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Kenya and Egypt. In total, more than 400 participants joined, demonstrating the [power of citizen science in tracking large-scale ecological processes](https://oceandecade.org/news/citizen-scientists-capture-coral-spawning-data-across-the-globe/). The results from the first wave of observations have already shown a fascinating discovery: the spawning of *Porites rus* occurred across vast distances, synchronized in a way that had never been observed before. Participants from French Polynesia reported the first sightings as early as 6:55 a.m. local time, with additional observations coming in from Mauritius, La Réunion Island, the Maldives and even as far as Chumbe Island in Tanzania, all within an hour and a half after sunrise at each location! This confirmed that *Porites rus* does indeed have the ability to synchronize its reproduction across great distances—exceeding 18,000 kilometers from one hemisphere to another.

8. [GenOcean](https://oceandecade.org/genocean/), an official Ocean Decade campaign, [focusing on citizen science](https://oceandecade.org/news/genocean-new-ocean-decade-campaign-highlighting-youth-citizen-scientists/) to collect, analyse and interpret data by tracking whale migrations, monitoring water quality and identifying marine life. Some of these projects are best suited for surfers, sailors or scuba divers, others are accessible to people anywhere in the world who have a laptop or a phone and an internet connection. GenOcean also features specific opportunities for young and emerging ocean advocates to become leaders in their communities through their local non-profit organizations and educational institutions. 

9. [Global Fishing Watch spotlights ocean governance successes](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-spotlights-ocean-governance-successes-highlighting-policy-wins-and-tech-innovations/), highlighting policy wins, tech innovations and critical breakthroughs in driving transparent and equitable ocean governance in their [2024 annual report](https://globalfishingwatch.org/annual-report-2024). Major strides across key initiatives were made: 900,000 vessels were tracked on the organisation's flagship map, 11 million gigabytes of satellite imagery were analysed and there were nearly 1,500 research citations. The past year also highlighted the broadening application of Global Fishing Watch tools beyond fisheries management, including in the climate and biodiversity spaces. Former United States Vice President Al Gore presented the [integration of Global Fishing Watch’s unique dataset into Climate TRACE’s platform](https://t.co/TbO4Q11t1P) which seeks to map and estimate the emissions of all ocean-faring industrial vessels. In addition, a [2024 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1950) led by the University of Washington and using Global Fishing Watch data made a breakthrough discovery in the biodiversity and marine protection space revealing that fewer than 7 percent of global hotspots for whale and ship collisions have protection measures in place.

10. On 25 February 2025, the Antarctic sea ice reached its minimum extent for the year, covering 1.87 million km2, according to Copernicus Marine data. This marks the seventh lowest minimum extent on record, tied with 2024, which is 8% below the 1993–2010 long-term average. Copernicus Marine provides key data to monitor these changes through parameters such as sea ice extent and thickness, which are analysed by Mercator Ocean International to provide insights into trends and patterns. According to their latest analysis, the minimum Antarctic sea ice extent for this year was reached on 25 February, at 1.87 million km2. Sea ice volume in the Antarctic has also reached near-record lows. On 5 March 2025, it reached its minimum, dropping to just 1,030 km³, a 56% decrease from the long-term average of 2,390 km³. This value is in line with the last four years, which were exceptionally low sea ice volume years. Sea ice volume refers to the total amount of ice present, considering both the surface area and the thickness of the ice. Unlike sea ice extent, which measures the total area covered by ice, monitoring the volume provides a more comprehensive view of the health and stability of the ice. A decrease in volume indicates not only a reduction in the area covered by ice, but also a thinning of the remaining ice, which is more susceptible to melting and ultimately accelerates the process of ice loss. The 2025 data confirm the [continuing decline of Antarctic sea ice](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-near-record-low-2025), with both extent and volume remaining well below historical averages. In recent years, Antarctic sea ice has consistently trended lower, with the minimum extents recorded since 2017 setting records as the five lowest extents since satellite records began 32 years ago. Notably, 2025 is also the second consecutive year with a sea ice minimum extent below 2 million km². Monitoring these shifts is key to understanding global ocean dynamics and climate trends, as changes in Antarctic sea ice influence global ocean currents, weather patterns, and ecosystems. 

11. As part of its adaptive management cycle, [California is considering proposed changes to its groundbreaking Network of marine protected areas (MPAs)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/seasketch-helps-stakeholders-explore-changes-mpas) through the California Fish and Game Commission’s (CFGC) petition process. [SeaSketch California](https://www.seasketch.org/california/app), an open-source marine spatial planning tool developed in the lab of NCEAS researcher Will McClintock, will provide a spatial tool for the public to interactively explore how the proposed changes modify the MPA Network. California’s marine protected areas are a network of discrete marine or estuarine areas in state waters designed to protect or conserve marine life and habitats. They encompass diverse ecosystems from beaches to offshore and seafloor habitats. Enacted into policy by the California Legislature in 1999 via the Marine Life Protection Act, and fully implemented in 2012, the MPA Network aims to protect the diversity of marine life and the habitats on which they depend. SeaSketch California has been customized to provide the public with access to the data that will be used to evaluate a set of petitions submitted by California Native American Tribes and members of the public that could modify parts of the MPA Network. SeaSketch California will allow interested stakeholders to visualize these changes and how they align with critical scientific guidelines and habitat protection goals.

12. With the [2025 United Nations Ocean Conference](https://unocnice2025.org/en/) just three months away, [80 newly endorsed Decade Actions are expanding the global Ocean Decade portfolio](https://oceandecade.org/news/accelerating-ocean-solutions-80-new-actions-fuel-the-ocean-decades-global-impact/) – now over 700 strong – driving ocean science in priority action areas across all ocean basins. From niche research to big-picture solutions, the 80 new Decade Actions cover a wide range of topics, including ocean prediction and coastal resilience to sustainable fisheries, ecosystem restoration, inclusive offshore renewable designs, and ocean journalism. Spanning 29 countries – from Chile and Indonesia to Pakistan, Malta, and Togo – they are primarily led by governmental and research institutions, as well as non-governmental and educational organizations.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [Global Renewables Watch](https://www.globalrenewableswatch.org/), a living atlas mapping and measuring utility-scale solar and wind installations across the Earth, is [now live](https://www.planet.com/pulse/global-renewables-watch/) to the public. This data-rich platform is built on Planet’s PlanetScope basemaps, offering high-cadence satellite imagery dating back to 2018. With this time-series data, users can evaluate energy transitions country-by-country, monitor land-use changes, and track trends over time. With the robust technical capabilities of Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, and The Nature Conservancy’s scientific rigor, the insights delivered in this platform offer an enlightening glimpse of a rapidly changing world. 

2. GBIF has [enabled](https://www.gbif.org/news/5PapgYCsbHPe7UWmEQTc5a/better-than-the-original-new-sql-based-service-enables-download-of-occurrence-data-cubes) a New SQL-based service that enables download of [species occurrence data cubes](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence-cubes). The new data cube service standardizes access to biodiversity data for producing [Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)](https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/) as well as indicator workflows and models for climate and land use change created by [B-Cubed partners](https://b-cubed.eu/partners). Specific [case studies](https://b-cubed.eu/case-studies) will test the capacity of indicator workflows to capture relevant aspects of biodiversity change based on different policy targets. As with other GBIF occurrence download formats, all successful queries are assigned unique and permanent DOIs to enable FAIR citation that enable attribution of credit to data publishers and aid reproducibility of downstream analyses.

**Indices and indicators**
1. The [World Development Indicators (WDI)](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) serves as a premier source for cross-country and time-series development statistics. [Covering nearly 1,500 indicators for 217 economies](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/inside-the-world-development-indicators--how-do-we-select-the-in), WDI has grown substantially since it first appeared as a modest set of tables in the 1978 World Development Report. Over time, it has become an open, easily accessible resource for users worldwide, including economists, policymakers, social scientists, and practitioners in fields as diverse as health, poverty, climate, and education. What makes WDI particularly valuable is the quality, relevance, and breadth of its coverage of its indicators, which allows users to conduct cross-country comparisons, long-run analyses going back to the 1960s, and quick policy checks. Yet as global development challenges diversify and data production expands, the list of potential indicators to include in the WDI grows too. From energy and digital access to specialized labor market statistics, WDI receives more potential indicators to include every year. Ultimately, this is an opportunity to grow our body of data and knowledge. However, unchecked expansion risks lowering quality or confusing users. By setting clear criteria, 1. Ease of use: easily accessible, understandable, and interoperable; 2. Trusted and relevant: unbiased and confidential data collection; 3. Adequate coverage: covers a substantial number of economies over multiple years, representing the target population comprehensively; and 4. High quality: ensuring data accuracy and comparability over time and across geographies, the WDI team can check if a proposed indicator offers enough coverage, solid methods, user relevance, and ease of use. This keeps WDI as the go-to reference for global development data.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. In the evolving landscape of Open Access research, [ensuring that repositories and data sources meet high standards of quality and interoperability is crucial](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-provide-new-validated-badge); [OpenAIRE PROVIDE](https://provide.openaire.eu/) plays a key role in this process by offering the "OpenAIRE Metadata Validator" to evaluate the compatibility level of data sources with the OpenAIRE Guidelines. The OpenAIRE validation process ensures that data sources adhere to [OpenAIRE’s guidelines](https://guidelines.openaire.eu/en/latest/), promoting consistency, accuracy, and interoperability of metadata. By passing this validation, data sources demonstrate their commitment to follow global standards to expose their metadata, enhancing the interoperability and quality of their content. Data sources that successfully meet OpenAIRE’s validation criteria can display the OpenAIRE Validated badge on their official website. This badge signals to researchers, institutions, and funders that the data source meets high standards for metadata quality and interoperability. Moreover, validated data sources are indexed in the OpenAIRE Graph, a vast, global interconnected research database, significantly improving discoverability and accessibility. Being validated by OpenAIRE ensures that a data source's content is more easily accessible to a global research community. This increases engagement, citation potential, and the overall impact of the research hosted within the data source.

2. [Shaping open infrastructures for responsible research assessment](https://www.openaire.eu/public-consultation-shaping-open-infrastructures-for-responsible-research-assessment) to support a fair, transparent, and responsible approach to research assessment. The [Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research Assessment: Principles and Framework](https://zenodo.org/records/14844582) is open for public consultation until March 14, 2025, and your feedback will help ensure it meets the needs of the global research community. The principles of Open Infrastructure are community governance (stakeholder-driven, inclusive decision-making that reflects scholarly diversity); transparency; openness (free access to data, metadata and software); sustainability (long-term financial stability); diversity (inclusive participation from all research communities); FAIR data; equity (universal access to research data and output); responsibility, integrity and accountability (reliable, ethically governed infrastructures); and innovation (adaptation to technical and social changes).

3. The [Biodiversity Data Journal](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) (BDJ) has become the [second scientific journal to take advantage of the GBIF hosted portals programme](https://www.gbif.org/news/6xd5bxWZxS6DriaVoVnFJ/biodiversity-data-journal-launches-gbif-hosted-portal), setting a key precedent for scientific publishers seeking to advance and support the reuse of FAIR biodiversity data using open infrastructure. The newly launched [portal](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) enables seamless integration of published articles and associated data elements with GBIF-mediated records, enhancing the visibility and dissemination of biodiversity data for authors and publishers. Users can explore more than 278,000 occurrence records across 837 datasets published to date through BDJ. 

4. The [Disentis Roadmap](https://www.bouchoutdeclaration.org/roadmap-2024/) has been [launched](https://plazi.org/posts/2025/03/the-disentis-roadmap/), a significant step towards providing access to data 'imprisoned' in scientific publications, in the sense that only humans can understand the content, and only if access to the publication is granted. Machines cannot read the data due to lack of access, standardization and other hurdles. With a corpus of over 500 million printed pages, a daily flood of new publications, and increasingly more powerful artificial intelligence-based tools, machine access is crucial for research, biodiversity conservation and an informed society. The Roadmap is a ten-year plan to liberate data from scientific publications and make biodiversity data an integral part of our daily knowledge. The Roadmap is based on the realization that we need to have full access to the scientific literature to write reports on the state of nature such as the IPBES reports, to expedite monitoring systems for biodiversity, understand nature in such basic terms as to provide a list of all the known species and access to all the knowledge about them.

5. The Amazon region is crucial for climate balance and biodiversity preservation. [DataMap/Amazon](https://datamap.pcs.usp.br/), an initiative of the Center for Sustainable Amazon Studies at the University of São Paulo (USP), promotes the production and dissemination of science for the sustainable development of the Amazon. It is a [comprehensive data platform designed to centralize and unify data discovery, visualization, and processing for research datasets](https://datacite.org/blog/advancing-research-through-datacites-global-access-fund-datamap-amazon-the-first-integrated-repository-of-scientific-atmospheric-data-from-the-amazon/), particularly atmospheric data. DataMap empowers researchers to find, analyze, and share datasets seamlessly by simplifying data access and reducing infrastructure complexity.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [iClimateAction: advancing earth intelligence through collaboration and innovation](https://earthobservations.org/news/iclimateaction-advancing-earth-intelligence-through-collaboration-and-innovation). The climate crisis demands better coordination, stronger data  integration and actionable intelligence. Funded by the European Union, the iClimateAction initiative strengthens collaboration between the Global Climate Observing System, World Meteorological Organization and GEO to streamline how climate data is collected, managed and transformed into decision-ready insights. Through iClimateAction, GEO will advance 2 key initiatives: [the global heat resilience service](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-heat-resilience-service), helping cities protect public health with real-time intelligence, and [the Global Ecosystem Atlas](https://globalecosystemsatlas.org/), a first-of-its kind open resource, consolidating ecosystem data to support adaptation, mitigation and nature-based solutions.

This two-part training will focus on describing and accessing remote sensing observations useful as water quality indicators of waterborne diseases, and will present case studies where remote sensing data are used to assess the likelihood of cholera outbreaks. 

3. [ARSET - introduction to NASA Earth Observations and tools for operational wildfire monitoring and management, an online course](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-introduction-nasa-earth-observations-and-tools-operational) from April 16 - 30, 2025. This three-part training will familiarize participants with the various modules available in the Fire Information for Resource Management System, explore the range of data and information available as well as the characteristics of satellite-based active fire detection, and provide hands-on experience that participants can apply to query, access and visualize the data in GIS and other applications.

4. Planet owns and operates the [largest fleet of Earth imaging satellites in history](https://www.planet.com/pulse/commercial-satellite-imagery-providers/), supporting three distinct constellations: PlanetScope®, which captures approximately 3 m resolution images of all of Earth's landmass at a near-daily basis; SkySat® and Pelican™, providing high-resolution data on a traditional tasking model, capable of capturing 50 cd imagery of a specific location on Earth multiple times per day; and Tanager™, delivering hyperspectral data at 30 m resolution with more than 400 spectral bands. Governments and businesses worldwide use Planet satellite imagery to optimize operations, drive growth, and achieve public benefits. Two significant examples are our collaborations with civil and national governments and global intelligence and defense organizations.

5. [Why Satellite Imagery Is Critical to Maritime Domain Awareness Solutions](https://www.planet.com/pulse/why-satellite-imagery-is-critical-to-maritime-domain-awareness-solutions/). From fishing to shipping to naval movements, maritime activity plays a considerable role in national security — and unauthorized or unrecognized activities contribute to geopolitical tension and uncertainty. Government agencies gather naval intelligence on a range of activities, including: illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; military and strategic infrastructure monitoring; illicit ship-to-ship transfers; and foreign military movements and operations. Planet satellites provide high-frequency images with global coverage, delivering a more complete picture than other visual surveillance techniques.

6. Our forests play a pivotal role in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change. [High-quality, regularly updated data on deforestation and carbon storage](https://www.planet.com/pulse/scaling-climate-impact-planet-partners-leverage-forest-carbon-monitoring-for-a-sustainable-future/) are crucial for the success of carbon markets and regulatory compliance. [Planet Forest Carbon Monitoring](https://www.planet.com/products/forest-carbon/) offers insights into global changes in canopy height, canopy cover, and aboveground carbon density, delivering quarterly updates at a 3-meter resolution. This level of detail enables stakeholders to detect subtle changes in forest structure, supporting accurate monitoring, reporting, and verification processes.

7. Coastal habitats, including marshes and wetlands, serve as lifelines for surrounding human communities and marine ecosystems. Maintaining the health of coastal zones is vital to sustaining biodiversity, ensuring food security, and promoting resilience against climate change. High-frequency Earth data and analytics from Planet help agencies regularly [monitor conditions in coastal environments, at any scale](https://www.planet.com/pulse/monitoring-coastal-habitats-that-support-local-communities-and-diverse-ecosystems-2/). This practice – known as broad area management – allows authorities to maximize efficiency and catch unexpected events early, reducing risk to ecosystems and communities.

8. The 10 Working Groups of FORCE11 that [started](https://force11.org/post/shape-the-future-of-scholarly-communications-join-force11-working-groups/) in February and will operate for 18 months, span a diverse set of areas in scholarly communications and research practices, from research data, books or peer review, to AI and metadata. Many of the [Working Groups](https://force11.org/active-groups/?mc_cid=58b5ccd7b8&mc_eid=3edfd27520) are actively recruiting members. 

9. The United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation – a critical moment to spotlight the rapid loss of mountain glaciers and snowpacks, and the urgent need to support the ecosystems and people who depend on them. Right now, Earth’s mountain glaciers and snowpacks are undergoing rapid and widespread decline, reshaping water availability, altering ecosystems, and impacting livelihoods at an accelerating pace. Given current trajectories in greenhouse gas emissions and the exacerbated climate-related impacts associated with it, the continuation of these trends is largely inevitable, there are signs of hope. GEO Mountains supports activities that can equip mountain communities, researchers, and practitioners including government agencies environment managers with the data and tools they need to make [informed decisions on adaption and build resilience in the face of an uncertain future](https://earthobservations.org/news/adapting-inevitable-how-data-can-drive-resilience-mountain-regions).

10. Europe is taking control of its digital future by [building open, trustworthy and multilingual Large Language Models](https://www.openaire.eu/llms4europe-launches-europe-builds-its-own-fine-tuned-large-language-models-for-key-sectors) tailored to European needs, for 5 strategic sectors: energy, telecommunications, tourism, public services and science. These models will support multilingual literature discovery, evidence synthesis, and automated policy briefs in areas such as life sciences and social sciences. Crucially, the pilot connects to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), leveraging Europe’s open science infrastructure to access, process, and validate scientific knowledge. OpenAIRE leads efforts to mobilise trusted, multilingual content from repositories, publishers, and scholarly societies, effectively building a Data Space connector to power the fine-tuned LLM models with FAIR and verified data. It will also co-develop applications to test the factual reliability of outputs, ensuring that AI tools for science remain transparent and accountable.

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The 20th edition of the World Economic Forum's [Global Risks Report](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/) lands with a stark warning: the planet is in peril. Topping the 10-year risk rankings are extreme weather events, the relentless loss of biodiversity, collapsing ecosystems and critical shifts in Earth's systems - threats that demand urgent attention. The [unravelling of Earth's ecosystems is perhaps the most insidious threat, yet it is often lost in translation](https://earthobservations.org/news/flying-blind-how-disrupting-ecosystems-puts-everything-risk). To understand the danger, think of Earth's ecosystems as a Boeing 747 aircraft - a complex and beautiful piece of engineering with 6 million parts, all working together to keep it in the air. On a 747, every part, every screw, has a defined role - a role which only it can do to help keep the plane in the air. Sure, you might still be able to fly if you take out just one screw, but there will be consequences. It's the same with ecosystems. Every species is optimally fitted for a specific function - if you remove one species, something else must then do that job, normally at a far lower efficiency. Removing or damaging parts puts increased stress on other parts of the system. Damage can cascade rapidly, driving an ecosystem to the brink of collapse - like a vibrant coral reef teeming with life deteriorating into an algae-covered grave.

2. The European Union (EU) awarded the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) EUR 27 million to [tackle organised crime networks trafficking in wildlife globally and reduce the demand driving this illicit trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-european-union-guard-wildlife-initiative-2025), in collaboration with civil society organizations. The new initiative, GUARD Wildlife - Global United Action to Reduce and Dismantle Organized Wildlife Crime - aims to conserve endangered species and biodiversity for future generations. GUARD Wildlife will enhance coordinated responses to combat wildlife crime at the national, regional and international levels and reduce illicit trafficking in wildlife and wildlife products in source, transit and destination countries. The initiative will unite key players to improve collaboration and strengthen information sharing. Efforts will also focus on bolstering national enforcement systems, including customs, police and border control, by providing expert mentorship and targeted support. Additionally, innovative demand-reduction efforts grounded in behavioural science will be implemented in consumer markets.

3. Operation Thunder 2024, which was held from the 11th of November to the 6th of December, brought police, customs, border control, forestry and wildlife officials from 138 countries and regions, together, marking the widest participation since the first edition in 2017, and resulted in the [seizing of nearly 20,000 live animals, all endangered or protected species](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-operation-thunder-2024). 365 suspects were arrested, and 6 transnational criminal networks suspected of trafficking animals and plants protected by CITES were identified. The live animals, which included big cats, birds, pangolins, primates and reptiles were rescued in connection with 2,213 seizures made worldwide. Where possible, wildlife forensic experts collected DNA samples before transferring the animals to conservation centres, where their health was assessed while awaiting repatriation or rehabilitation, in line with national frameworks and relevant protocols. The collection of DNA is a crucial part of supporting prosecutions, as it helps confirm the type of species and its origin or distribution, shedding light on new trafficking routes and emerging trends. In addition to the live animals, participating countries seized hundreds of thousands of protected animal parts and derivatives, trees, plants, marine life and arthropods. More than 100 companies involved in the trafficking of protected species were also identified.

4. [Call for nominations for the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award is open](https://www.gbif.org/news/4AAE2KOKBRJ0iS2DE2fT65/call-for-nominations-opens-for-2025-gbif-graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to highlight innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master's and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data. The 2025 programme will provide two €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers. Candidates receive formal nominations from the node managers and heads of delegation from GBIF Participant countries, who generally select one master's and one PhD candidate whose nominations are then forwarded to the GBIF Secretariat. Candidates must be either a citizen of a country participating in GBIF or a student at an institution located in a GBIF participant country. National node managers and/or heads of delegation may submit 2 nominees per country by the 27th of June 2025. The country deadlines vary, the earliest known deadline is the 24th of May in Mexico and South Africa.

5. World Wetlands Day was held on the 2nd of February, with the theme '[Protecting wetlands for our common future](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2740)', to remind us of the benefits wetlands provide for biodiversity and human wellbeing: wetlands help us cope with the impacts of climate change and secure critical freshwater resources. Wetlands are protected under many conservation instruments, many have been recognised not only as Ramsar sites, but also as UNESCO World Heritage properties and Biosphere Reserves, yet they are among the planet's most threatened ecosystems. 

6. Cocoa production has been linked to high rates of deforestation and biodiversity loss, making it a significant contributor to environmental degradation. Addressing and mitigating these negative impacts is essential for [achieving a more sustainable cocoa supply chain](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/ecom-reducing-deforestation-cocoa-supply-chain/). ECOM, one of the world's largest cocoa traders and processors that sources from over 30 countries, has made it a priority to reduce the negative impacts from their operations. One way to do that is by applying a standardised [methodology](https://www.wri.org/research/mapping-cocoa-assessing-deforestation-risk-cocoa-cote-divoire-ghana) developed by the World Resources Institute to ensure the cocoa beans they use are sustainably sourced and are not linked to forest loss. ECOM adapted its methodology to carry out widespread risk assessment in a standardised manner, expanding the model to other geographies and analysing data from Cameroon, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, Mexico, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Vietnam and Uganda. Once high-risk areas have been identified, ECOM works with smallholder farmers to proactively tackle cocoa-linked deforestation, focusing on prevention through strategies like sensitization training or Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs. The focus on high-risk locations enables further engagement with farmers and remediation to avoid excluding them from the supply chain, which can lead to worse outcomes and accelerate deforestation.

**Climate**
1. The [Egyptian Carbon Center has been named an Accelerator for the Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/egyptian-carbon-center-appointed-accelerator-for-the-race-to-zero/), a key role that highlights its leadership in carbon management and sustainability. This partnership aims to accelerate the decarbonization efforts of companies worldwide, providing them with essential tools and guidance to achieve net zero emissions. As an Accelerator, the Egyptian Carbon Center will offer companies access to cutting-edge resources and tailored strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. This collaboration supports businesses in setting ambitious climate goals, implementing effective decarbonization practices, and fostering long-term environmental and economic benefits. Partnering with the Egyptian Carbon Center will help companies drive innovation and enhance competitiveness by adopting green technologies.

2. It is widely acknowledged that the world needs to move away from its dependence on fossil fuels. However, the shift to renewable sources is not without its own environmental and social impacts. Experts at UNEP-WCMC have co-authored a [new working paper](https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/critical-transitions-circularity-equity-and-responsibility-quest-energy) that examines the potential costs of the green energy transition. The need for an energy transition is clear, and is reflected in the rapid growth of renewable energy industries in recent years (between 2011 and 2023, renewable energy production capacity increased five-fold). However, [moving from fossil fuels to these alternative sources is not straightforward](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/the-green-energy-transition-and-mining); it requires a vast amount of natural resources in order to build and develop the infrastructure. Furthermore, there is a risk of exacerbating existing inequalities: with nearly three-quarters of the world's population currently lacking access to electricity, we must ensure that people are not left behind. As the working paper points out, there are significant hurdles to overcome to meet the unprecedented demand for critical minerals. Distribution of these resources is concentrated in specific regions around the world, and so supply can be vulnerable to trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, it takes around 16 years on average to fully establish a new mining operation, and this can be much longer as a result of the unpredictable factors outlined above. Another issue is quality: as many of the world's easily accessible mineral deposits have already been mined, average grades of minerals (that is, the amount of metal within the ore body) are declining. This means that more rock needs to be mined to produce the same amount of metal, which in turn means more energy is used. Beyond these supply issues, there are pressing concerns about the wider environmental and social impacts of mining processes. Some of these are direct and obvious. For example, clearing land for extraction and processing operations destroys wildlife habitats and displaces local communities. Similarly, the chemicals used in processing create air and water pollution which can harm the health of both animal and human populations.

**Oceans**
1. Argo, the global network of autonomous floats that revolutionized ocean observation, marked its 25th anniversary in December. Since its inception, Argos has grown into a fleet of nearly 4,000 robotic floats, drifting with ocean currents and conducting dives of up to 6,000 meters. These floats collect critical data that contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), allowing us to [better understand changes in ocean heat, sea level rise, and circulation, improve weather and extreme event forecasts, and help society manage and adapt to climate change](https://goosocean.org/news/celebrating-25-years-of-argo-a-pillar-of-the-global-ocean-observing-system/). 

2. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps, a [reliable marine biodiversity foresight solution](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/23/species-distribution-maps/), is an important tool for Ocean protection. Using cutting-edge model-based capacities, the [OBIS Species Distribution Maps](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/) allows marine planners and decision-makers to identify, better manage and protect the biodiversity-rich areas of tomorrow's Ocean. Developed as a key component of the ambitious EU-funded MPA Europe project, the OBIS Species Distribution Map brings many advances, such as the integration of the five latest IPCC climate change scenarios, at an unparalleled resolution. As a marine biodiversity foresight solution, the OBIS Species Distribution Map fully supports crucial global biodiversity objectives such as achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework “30x30” target. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps are at the heart of the MPA Europe project's innovative approach. The project integrates blue carbon storage estimations, ocean connectivity, climate velocity, and marine biodiversity predictions into a prioritization tool, providing a holistic vision that supports decision-makers in implementing future Marine Protected Areas. This holistic approach translated into a challenging requirement for the OBIS team to match the project's ambitions.

3. Over the past year, data from the Copernicus Marine Service has been at the forefront of a [collaboration between Ocean Energy Europe and Mercator Ocean International](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/data-innovation-copernicus-marine-and-ocean-energy). This collaboration has showcased the impactful role Copernicus Marine has played in advancing the ocean energy sector. The collaboration aimed to bridge the gap between data providers and the industry by highlighting the practical applications of free, high-resolution ocean data in renewable energy development. By providing detailed information on ocean conditions such as currents, wave height, and salinity, this service supports decision-making at every stage of project development - from site selection to operations and maintenance. A key milestone of the collaboration was the identification and promotion of five use cases: 1. [CorPower Ocean: identifying global wave energy potential & projecting future energy systems](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/identifying-global-wave-energy-potential), 2. [Mocean Energy: optimising wave energy: Copernicus Marine Data for site selection and performance](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/optimising-wave-energy), 3. [MESPAC: Innovative solutions for offshore energy: MESPAC's AI-powered data enhancement](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/offshore-energy-mespacs-ai-powered-data), 4. [IMDC: the iMED model supporting Ocean Energy in the Mediterranean](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/supporting-Ocean-Energy-in-Mediterranean), and 5. [Minesto: harnessing predictable tidal energy in the Faroe Islands](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/harnessing-predictable-tidal-energy-faroe-islands). 

4. [The Copernicus Marine Service 2 (2021 - 2028) will start the second phase of its operations from 2025 to 2028, building on the success of Phase 1](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-2-enters-its-second-phase). The Copernicus Marine Service has expanded rapidly with a significant rise in user uptake. Phase 1 of Copernicus 2 (2021-2024) saw more than 88,000 users register for the service, growing by 30% on an annual basis. Similarly, the Copernicus Marine website attracts 1.5 million individual visitors each year, a 52% rise in unique visitors since 2023. The second phase of the Copernicus Marine Service 2 will focus on improving the service to maintain and reinforce its position as a world-leading marine monitoring service. Evolutions of Thematic Assembly Centres and Monitoring Forecasting Centres products will include the integration of new satellite missions (e.g. SWOT) and in situ observations, better processing techniques, models, coupling and data assimilation and an increasing use of Artificial Intelligence.

5. The Copernicus Marine Service is committed to continuously improving the quality and fitness-for-purpose of the design of its products and services. In line with these efforts, twelve downstream services have been [launched](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-new-projects-improve-coastal-monitoring-and-support-eu) as pilot demonstrations for EU Coastal Monitoring activities. The 12 funded projects are expected to deliver significant value to users, strengthen collaboration with national marine and coastal initiatives, and showcase the practical applications and benefits of Copernicus Marine data. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. Freshwaters are some of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet, and insufficient data availability contributes to challenges in conserving these essential environments. To support freshwater data holders, GBIF has [released](https://www.gbif.org/news/m6FopQ34VB8Bxcw2stU1T/new-guide-released-to-support-freshwater-data-publishing) the [Freshwater Data Publishing Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-sw3k-w725) to better support data-intensive research, policy, and management of these environments. This guide is part of a [series of digital documentation guides](https://www.gbif.org/training#_gbif-digital-guides) currently open for community peer review.

**News and updates about applications**
1. The latest update of the Copernicus Marine [MyOcean Pro Viewer](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/myocean-viewer), v.13, an interactive online tool that allows users to visualise and download Copernicus Marine data, has been [released](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/myocean-pro-viewer-update-situ-data-and-streamline-visualisation). It provides an intuitive interface to explore a wide range of oceanographic datasets, including satellite observations, numerical models, and in situ measurements. With this update, the MyOcean Pro Viewer now enables users to explore in situ observations collected from a series of geo-referenced platforms, such as floats, drifters, and gliders. When selecting an in situ platform, users can now access detailed information, along with time series or profile graphs. Moreover, the Viewer now allows users to combine graphs from different platforms into a single interface. This streamlined capability makes it easy to compare measurements such as temperature, salinity, and currents across various locations. These features make the access to in situ data, which are essential for understanding regional ocean dynamics, easier, more intuitive, and suitable for a wide range of user needs.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt) (EJT) — a leading electronic open-access journal for taxonomic research — has become the first scientific journal to [launch](https://www.gbif.org/news/2JHV6IsWcUUrD57I3FgXIQ/european-journal-of-taxonomy-launches-gbif-hosted-portal) a [GBIF hosted portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/), paving the way for other academic publishers to participate in the programme. This marks a move to elevate the access, reuse and interoperability of [material citations](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/a064f300-1bc8-41ea-9364-b864ef4e8938), traditionally confined within PDFs, that are now disseminated through published datasets. Users can explore features such as [data clustering](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/occurrence/search/?view=CLUSTERS) which enables discovery of potentially related occurrences by identifying related type specimens and linkages between records from different sources. This feature in combination with powerful [search tools](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/occurrence/search/) and [dashboard visualization](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/dashboard/) extends the reach of occurrences in GBIF to taxonomic treatments and publications through the [EJT portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/).

2. [FAIRsharing and FIPs (FAIR implementation profiles): where we are, where we are headed](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=971). At the core of putting FAIR in practice are the choices that have to be made when selecting the appropriate standards (i.e., terminologies, models, formats, minimal information requirements, and identifier schema) and databases (repositories and knowledge bases). These resources are essential to describe, report and identify, as well as share research objects (e.g., datasets, code, workflows). Often each project, group or organisation (i.e., community) has its own norms. To map this landscape, the concept of the FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) was created in 2019 together with ENVRI-FAIR and developed in a series of projects guided by the GO FAIR Foundation, to represent a collection of declarations a community makes about the usage of FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), including standards, services and policies. Across all disciplines, however, there are thousands of standards, databases and policies, which are core FERs; and this is where [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) comes in. An informative and educational service on standards, inter-related to databases and data policies, across all disciplines, FAIRsharing guides consumers and producers to discover, select and use these resources with confidence, producers to make their resource more discoverable, more widely adopted and cited. The description of these resources are curated and tagged according to the maturity (i.e., ready, in development, deprecated, uncertain) to reflect their very dynamic evolution. [FIP Wizard](https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org/) is specialised for the creation of FIPs, and provides templates organised as questionnaires. The integration of the FIP Wizard with FAIRsharing makes use of its rich content.

3. Ecological monitoring data, whether gathered through traditional on-the-ground surveys or emerging approaches around sensor networks, forms the gold standard for understanding biodiversity on a changing planet. However, the lack of a standardized way of collecting such essential information about methods has limited its reuse, leaving researchers and practitioners unable to leverage the power of survey datasets to monitor changing biodiversity trends. [Survey and Monitoring Data Quick-Start Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-7t3p-ve38): A how-to for updating a Darwin Core dataset using the Humboldt Extension takes a [key step toward closing this gap](https://www.gbif.org/news/17fTMFas4AhM3tvzPvp882/enhancing-discovery-and-reuse-of-survey-and-monitoring-data-with-new-guide). The standardized vocabulary of 55 new terms that Humboldt introduces allows data publishers to capture consistent contextual information about survey and monitoring activities and maximize the reusability of the resulting records.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. Beds of iceplant, dotted with daisy-like flowers, carpet the roadside and bluffs of coastal California. Although they look beautiful, this familiar plant is an invader: it chokes out native plants and salts the earth beneath it, it prevents sand from moving on the wind to replenish beaches and dunes. NCEAS researchers are collaborating with NASA and The Nature Conservatory to develop a comprehensive map of iceplant. To eradicate invasive species, land managers need to know where it grows. With NASA's support, the project will use [deep learning to combine satellite, airplane and drone images into a single comprehensive map](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/mapping-invader). The Nature Conservatory has begun treating the first 300 acres of iceplant (from an estimated 1,000 acres across the Dangermond Preserve in California), as as the project progresses, ongoing mapping will guide to where iceplant might hide among native vegetation or where it may have resurged.

2. In three months, from the 5th to the 9th of May, [Rome will welcome Earth observations experts, academics, industry leaders and policymakers](https://earthobservations.org/news/rome-gears-geo-global-forum-2025-where-global-leaders-will-shape-future-earth-intelligence) from around the world for the [GEO Global Forum 2025](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025). Data-driven solutions have the power to change how we understand and care for the planet: helping farmers adopt more efficient and sustainable practices, communities adapt to the climate crisis and businesses innovate. But to truly unlock this potential, we must turn data into action with solutions that pair advanced technology with human empathy, ethics and experience,because technology alone won't solve the climate and nature crisis, according to Yana Gevorgyan, Director of the GEO Secretariat. A high-level ministerial meeting will bring leaders together to agree on practical steps for using Earth Intelligence to achieve net-zero and nature-positive goals, build resilience to extreme heat and deliver early warnings for all. The Plenary will also include a pledging event to secure political and financial commitments for the implementation of GEO’s Post-2025 Strategy. Additionally, youth leaders will take centre stage, highlighting GEO’s ongoing commitment to intergenerational collaboration.

3. IMB, C40 Cities and the Group of Earth Observations announced a new collaboration aimed at scaling up social innovation action in cities around the world. In alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the new project will develop [artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to advance city resiliency and address specific challenges facing urban communities](https://earthobservations.org/news/ibm-c40-cities-and-group-earth-observations-collaborate-new-ai-project-resilient-cities). With support from the Group on Earth Observations , IBM and C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities, will work together to create a data-driven, AI-powered solution to help cities analyze potential risks that may arise as a result of extreme heat and the urban heat island effect. These can include stressed energy resources, increases in mortality rates, and socioeconomic disparities. The new solution will aim to enable cities to create adaptation strategies to help alleviate population health risks and economic burdens, while strengthening national resilience efforts.

4. Agriculture, forestry, and land use emissions have a notable influence on global climate change, contributing 26% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In response, environmental policies increasingly require sustainable agricultural practices like [carbon farming, which maximize carbon sequestration](https://www.planet.com/pulse/a-guide-to-carbon-farming-and-what-it-means-for-global-sustainability-efforts/). But confirming compliance with evolving mandates can be challenging. Manual data collection is costly and time consuming, making it difficult to scale operations to meet new requirements. With high-frequency satellite data and analytics, agencies can detect and monitor agricultural activity, at scale. Let's explore how this practice, known as broad area management, helps stakeholders quantify change within agricultural parcels, verify compliance, and work towards emission reduction targets. Carbon farming, also known as regenerative agriculture, aims to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil, by maximizing plant growth and minimizing soil disturbance. When plants die, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is either released back into the atmosphere or stored for long periods of time in the soil. Many conventional agriculture practices, such as tilling, result in the release of carbon. However, practices classified under carbon farming aim to do the opposite, by putting carbon back into the soil and keeping it there: no-till farming: avoiding plowing and tilling to minimise soil disturbance and erosion; crop rotation and intercropping: diversifying crops to improve soil health; planting cover crops: growing crops to cover the soil rather than for harvesting; and agroforestry: integrating trees and shrubs into crop fields to improve soil structure and keep carbon in the ground.

5. [Tutorial using Google Earth Engine with GBIF mediated occurrences](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/2025-01-23-time-series-of-land-surface-temperature/): exploring how to integrate remote sensing data with biodiversity observations to analyse the relationships between environmental factors and species occurrence, following an example of analysing the Land Surface Temperature over time and its relationship to observations of the songbird the Northern Cardinal. 

6. Since 2016, over 3,600 scientific publications using Planet data have been published, showcasing Planet data's widespread impact across a variety of disciplines in both industry and academia. The constant stream of new research makes digesting these insights a significant challenge—just last year, two new manuscripts were published every day. To help synthesize the vast amounts of published research, a large language model (LLM) was used to [explore whether cutting-edge AI technologies can assist in extracting insights on Planet data usage and applications](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ai-enabled-insights-from-publications-leveraging-planet-data/) from our growing publication database. With a focus on identifying the contexts (e.g., agriculture, forestry, environmental monitoring) in which the data is applied, the most frequently used data products, and the geographies of both the study authors and their study regions. As researchers drive new discoveries with Planet data and share through scientific publications, we expect AI tools to accelerate insights and enhance collaboration across disciplines. The model correctly extracted answers for most of the questions and manuscripts, with 90% accuracy for most of the manuscripts, the highest error rate (4.2%) occurred when identifying the type of product used (e.g., PlanetScope Imagery, Basemaps, Fusion). This challenge arises because authors may refer to Planet Basemaps simply as 'Planet Imagery' or use different terms for PlanetScope Imagery, such as 'Dove Imagery', 'CubeSats Imagery', or 'SuperDove Imagery'.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. A webinar as part of the IPPN Knowledge Café: [How can integrated policies deliver the UN common approaches to biodiversity and pollution?](https://www.sparkblue.org/event/webinar-ippn-knowledge-cafe-how-can-integrated-policies-deliver-the-UN-common-approaches-to-biodiversity-and-pollution) which was held on the 22nd of January 2025.

Health systems and health policies interact with other elements of the nexus and can strengthen the response to climate change, both on the mitigation and adaptation front. This seminar will focus on how poor outcomes for other nexus sectors translate to poor human health.



### Issue 1
Date: 22 January 2025

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. [Highlighting the worldviews and voices of African Indigenous Peoples at the BES-Net Regional Trialogue for West and Central Africa](https://www.besnet.world/highlighting-the-worldviews-and-voices-of-african-indigenous-peoples-at-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-west-and-central-africa/). The Trialogue was structured around specific and multi-stakeholder objectives: contextualizing knowledge, addressing issues related to invasive alien species and the sustainable use of wild species to enhance food security and human well-being, analysing the challenges of implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The central question of the meeting was: "How can we reconcile this very specific scale of local terrain with the scale of national policy - as well as for the UN on a global scale - in order to ensure the stability of the planet and our ability to manage ecosystems well, while taking into account the different realities experienced in relationships with nature?"

2. New [WWF-led research](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-led-research-highlights-invisible-wildlife-benefits-people-receive-but-could-lose-if-biodiversity-crisis-ignored), which has been [published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44358-024-00006-9), reveals that the vital benefits wildlife provides to people's everyday lives are vastly underrepresented across science and policy discussions. This oversight could have detrimental consequences for achieving global conservation targets. The concept of Nature's Contributions to People is well-established in science, business and policy, and it is often assumed that protecting a habitat or ecosystem will automatically preserve the benefits people rely on. Out of 18 NCP categories, as defined by IPBES, the study found that at least 12 are directly supported by wildlife, ranging from material benefits, such as food and livelihoods from fish or game species, to non-material values including ecotourism, medicinal uses, and a sense of identity or well-being. Long-term loss of wildlife will lead to declines in its contributions to people and ultimately harm people's wellbeing. A well-known example is the case of the North American sea otters. The 19th century fur trade led to a loss of the otter populations, after which an explosion in sea urchins destroyed kelp forests. This had severe consequences for fish populations, local fishing communities, and coastal ecosystems, making the area more vulnerable to storms and erosion and reducing the resources available to Indigenous communities that relied on kelp.

3. IUCN Save Our Species and the International Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme supported [vital projects that supported local communities, and protected threatened species as well as their habitats](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2024-our-year-in-review/), translating global goals into concrete action to support community conservation action. Some of the highlights of 2024 include: 2 calls for proposals: the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund with a focus on threatened ungulates, and SOS Lemurs; the SOS African Wildlife Initiative lessons learned workshop on achievements, shared lessons and explored strategies for human-wildlife conflict mitigation, biodiversity monitoring and community engagement; 2 reports, the [Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme on 10 years of tiger conservation](https://iucnsos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IUCN-ITHCP-150pdi-Spreads-DIGITAL.pdf) and an [impact report on the SOS African Wildlife initiative's rapid action grants](https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/iucn-celebrates-10-impactful-years-tiger-conservation-new-report) which showed that the €3.8 million investment across 23 African countries resulted in the protection of 58 threatened species.

4. New [natural forest data on Global Forest Watch](https://gfw.global/4fQfl03) from the [Science Based Target Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/) Natural Lands Map can help shed light on where the world's natural forests are located and provide a baseline for monitoring loss within them since 2020. The map, developed through a collaboration of Land & Carbon Lab, WWF and Systemiq, supports companies who have committed to eliminate conversion of natural lands in their supply chains through targets set with the SBTN land sector framework.

**Climate**
1. The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2024 annual global climate report](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202413); 2024 is officially the planet's [warmest year on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record). The 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. Additionally, the Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to its second-lowest extent on record, as well as the upper ocean heat content, the amount of heat stored in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, was the highest on record. Ocean heat content is a key climate indicator because the ocean stores 90% of the excess heat in the Earth system, and the five highest values have all occurred in the last five years.

2. [Wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area since the 7th of January](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained), displacing tens of thousands of people and destroying large areas. While California is no stranger to summer wildfires (typically starting in June and continuing through October when the weather is hot and dry), this January outbreak is an outlier, fueled by unusually severe fire weather conditions across the state's southern region. During most years, no fire alerts are detected in Los Angeles in the first three months of the year. Only in 2021, one of the most devastating years regarding wildfires in California, more than 10 fire alerts had been detected between January and March. In 2025, over 170 fire alerts had been detected by the 13th of January. 

3. The United Kingdom Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is leading a [significant 5-year research initiative](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/international-science-net-zero-plus), focussing on the effects of climate change on air and water quality, land use, and estimating the potential for greenhouse gas removal. To expand the accessibility of the program's digital outputs beyond academic papers and reports, UKCEH has chosen the [online platform MapX for wider dissemination](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/adsfoiuv9). 

**Oceans**
1. The [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network is playing a crucial role in understanding and protecting the vital ecosystem of the Northern California Current](https://marinebon.org/the-marine-biodiversity-network-keeps-an-eye-on-the-california-current/). Researchers and agencies are being brought together, and MBON is facilitating collaboration and data sharing, enabling scientists to study the current dynamics more effectively. As the current delivers cool water from the north (British Columbia), wind driven upwelling brings colder, nutrient-rich water from the ocean depths up to the surface. Those nutrients give a boost to marine phytoplankton that feed whales, seals, seabirds and other wildlife, as well as the iconic seafood of the Oregon coast and the fishing communities that depend on them. Understanding the past and present of the current, will enable everyone depending on it to be as ready as possible for an uncertain future.

2. A new study, [published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4541-3), has found that ocean warming in 2024 has led to [new record high temperatures](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sea-surface-and-deeper-water-temperatures-reached-new-record-high-2024) and discusses how a hotter ocean affects our lives on land and what this means for our future. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 meters ocean heat content increased by 16 zettajoules, which was approximately 40 times the world's total electricity generation in 2023. Ocean heat is the best measurement to monitor climate change. Increasing ocean heat content affects marine ecosystems, currents, sea ice, the way water separates into layers, climate variation and evolution, global weather systems, ocean-atmosphere interactions, sea level, the ocean's carbon cycle, oxygen levels, and human livelihoods. 

3. The Copernicus Marine Service [announced](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-release-copernicus-marine-toolbox) the latest major release of the [Copernicus Marine Toolbox](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/collections/9080063-copernicus-marine-toolbox), bringing a host of enhancements, such as a greater flexibility for integrating with diverse workflows, from high-performance computing systems to lightweight solutions like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.

4. International networks, citizen science initiatives, research institutes, universities and NGOs [working on marine biodiversity data are invited to participate in the DTO Bioflow second open call for marine biodiversity (monitoring) data](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/17/eudto-2ndcall/). These calls invite institutions to contribute to the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO) by making their data available through EMODnet Biology, a portal providing open, free access to interoperable data on the temporal and spatial distribution of marine species (e.g., angiosperms, benthos, birds, fish, macroalgae, mammals, reptiles, phyto- and zooplankton) from European regional seas. EMODnet runs the European OBIS node, so data in EMODnet also flows to the global OBIS data platform. Selected participants will receive funding of up to €60,000 per institution to support integrating their data into the EU DTO. The [submission deadline is the 28th of February 2025](https://dto-bioflow.eu/second-open-call-marine-biodiversity-data).

5. As the Ocean Decade enters its midpoint, [a new batch of 39 Decade Actions is setting the stage for transformative ocean solutions](https://oceandecade.org/news/wave-of-new-ocean-decade-actions-launch-the-year-ahead/), driving ocean sustainability worldwide. The new initiatives address ocean pollution, coastal resilience, hands-on citizen science, and a sustainable ocean economy. 

6. At the end of 2024, [51 IOI Ocean Academy courses have been delivered](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-ioi-ocean-academy-another-successful-year-of-outreach-and-global-growth-with-51-ioi-ocean-academy-courses-successfully-delivered-in-16-languages/) globally by the IOI Ocean Academy Directors. The programmes were offered in 16 local languages and dialects: Arabic, Dhivehi, English, French, Georgian, Hindi, Kiswahili, Marathi, Portuguese, Sinhala, Spanish, Thai, Tunesian Dialect, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu.  

7. The BNP Paribas Foundation [launches a new 'climate and biodiversity initiative' call](https://oceandecade.org/news/bnp-paribas-foundation-climate-biodiversity-initiative-call-for-projects/) for projects dedicated to the ocean and coastal ecosystems. Applicants can [submit their projects](https://climate-and-biodiversity-initiative.fondation.bnpparibas/en/) from 21 January to the 4th of May. The call is open to all scientific teams from Europe conducting research on subjects focusing on climate and biodiversity related to ocean and coastal ecosystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Planet launched their high-resolution Pelican-2 satellite and 36 SuperDoves of Flock 4G to orbit on SpaceX's Transporter-12 Rideshare mission](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-launches-high-resolution-pelican-2-satellite-36-superdoves/). Successful contact has been made, and the commissioning process has started. 

2. The use of spatial data can be transformative in the face of climate change, biodiversity loss, and development challenges, as it enables national governments, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples and local communities and researchers to make data-driven decisions to prioritise action and monitor progress towards their goals more accurately. To support these decisionmakers, [UN Biodiversity Lab](http://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/) was developed. It [provides](https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UNBL-brochure_English.pdf) historic and current spatial data on nature, ecosystem services, climate change and sustainable development; it helps developing easy-to-understand maps; provides automatic summaries of biodiversity trends and environmental change; and has clear source information and other metadata.

**News and updates about applications**
1. It is now possible to [show maps on a 3D globe](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2025/01/3d-globe-maps-using-a-javascript-sdk/) using MapTiler SDK with just one line of code. 

**Indices and indicators**
1. [Updated indicators demonstrate best practice for positive impacts on biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/capturing-the-positive-impacts-of-sustainable-land-use-investment-for-investors). Financial institutions are starting to realise the opportunities that investing in sustainable land use brings. In particular, impact investors are increasingly moving into this space, looking to add investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and ecosystem restoration to their portfolios. Such investments generate not only financial returns, but also have positive impacts on biodiversity, climate adaptation and mitigation, and local livelihoods. However, it is important that these impacts are measured and evidenced robustly, yet cost-effectively, and achieving this balance can be tricky. Therefore, the [Positive Impact Indicators Directory](https://landuseimpacthub.com/en/kpis) was developed by UNEP-WCMC and UNEP in 2019. This Directory contains a shortlist of indicators to help investors measure their positive impact across several areas: biodiversity, sustainable production, climate action and livelihoods. The [Directory was updated early 2025](https://kpi-directory.production.wordpress-linode.linode.unep-wcmc.org/content//uploads/2025/01/Guide-on-indicator-changes-Jan-2025.pdf): Forest indicators were merged into existing biodiversity and sustainable production indicators to ensure clarity in categorising and avoid duplication; ecosystem extent indicators were streamlined; indicators which relied on counterfactual calculations, which was not suitably robust, were removed; indicators capturing ecosystem condition and indicators for species presence were added; and significant flags were integrated in some of the indicators to align with best practices and to guide investors to take action where it matters most.  

2. A groundbreaking new study, '[Governance and resilience as entry points for transforming food systems in the countdown to 2030](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/78839aee-a0f2-4741-aade-67e526f962f6)', published in Nature Food, presents the [first comprehensive analysis of change since 2000 in key food system indicators](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-report-highlights-critical-food-system-trends-and-challenges-in-countdown-to-2030/en). This report shows that tradeoffs are inevitable between food systems goals such as jobs, climate, nutrition, food security and resilience. With stronger governance and better data, these tradeoffs can be mitigated and even flipped into synergies.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. This year marks the [20th anniversary of the Group on Earth Observations](https://earthobservations.org/news/celebrating-20-years-earth-intelligence-milestone-group-earth-observations) (GEO). One of GEO's enduring legacies is its commitment to open knowledge, and initiatives like the [GEO Knowledge Hub](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/) are turning data into actionable insights, integrating citizen science, Indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge technology to ensure equitable access to Earth intelligence. In May, the [GEO Global Forum](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025) will be held in Rome, where experts, policymakers and stakeholders from around the world will explore how Earth intelligence can address today's critical issues.

## Agenda for upcoming conferences, webinars and events
*22 January, 2025*, 14.00 - 15.00 CET, Webinar as part of the IPPN Knowledge Café: [How can integrated policies deliver the UN common approaches to biodiversity and pollution?](https://www.sparkblue.org/event/webinar-ippn-knowledge-cafe-how-can-integrated-policies-deliver-the-UN-common-approaches-to-biodiversity-and-pollution)

*29 January, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [introduction](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CewuDyZETdKYMJfSvyeSsQ) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). In this seminar, an introduction and overview of the Nexus and Transformative Change assessments is given, and how they are connected.

*26 February, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [second seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_de9YnGasQj292mPDG-S3sA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). In this seminar, the focus will be on biodiversity as the first and most fundamental nexus element.

*10 - 11 March, 2025*, the third edition of the International Ocean Data Conference, online and in Santa Marta, Colombia: [The data we need for the ocean we want](https://oceandataconference.org/iodc-iii-programme)

*26 March, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [third seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_E89GSYmMT_2Wv0SPz8dptA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). A stable climate underpins the continued functioning of all other benefits across the nexus. While climate change mitigation or adaptation actions often have positive impacts on other parts of the nexus, some have potential negative impacts. This seminar will focus on how producing energy has impacts on all nexus elements, so transitioning to low carbon energy and energy demand management will be necessary.

*30 April, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fourth seminar: Food](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_r5RkHrUkSbmUL4p28JuL6g) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Access to food and to live free from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity is a fundamental human right. This seminar will focus on the response options considered ranging from production-based approaches to governance and dietary approaches.

*28 May, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fifth seminar: Water](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BH2xMZwaTyGjjiwGSoyv5w) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). This seminar will focus on the analysis of response options including consideration of interactions between freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems while also incorporating nature's contributions to people.

*25 June, 2025*, The sixth seminar: Health of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Health systems and health policies interact with other elements of the nexus and can strengthen the response to climate change, both on the mitigation and adaptation front. This seminar will focus on how poor outcomes for other nexus sectors translate to poor human health.
