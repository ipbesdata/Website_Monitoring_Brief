**Biodiversity**
1. [Every pumpkin needs a bee](https://www.besnet.world/every-pumpkin-needs-a-bee-the-critical-role-of-pollinators-in-crop-production/), the critical role of pollinators in crop production. Bees, butterflies and other insects play an unseen but vital role in producing the fruits, vegetables, oilseeds and fodder that feed the world. More than three-quarters of the world’s leading food crops rely, to some extent, on animal pollination, which contributes to 35 per cent of global crop production volume. As part of the process to raise awareness of the value of pollinators at the local level, two entomologists from KEPHIS and NMK worked together with 30 local farmers to set up an experiment in the Eburu Forest Ecosystem in Kenya to estimate the value of pollination in crop production. In the study, the value of wild and managed insect pollination services was approximated to the income that would be lost if these pollinators were unavailable to fertile plants dependent on insect pollination. To understand how much crops depend on pollinators, the team set up side-by-side plots of pumpkin and canola in Eburu and Olesirwa villages. In a method called a “pollination exclusion experiment,” some flowers were carefully covered with fine mesh bags to keep pollinators out, while others were left open, allowing pollinators to access them. The production from pollinator-excluded flowers was compared with that from pollinator-included flowers to generate data on the dependence of the crops on pollinators and their economic benefits.

2. [How Indigenous Peoples and local communities shaped Cambodia's National Ecosystem Assessment](https://www.besnet.world/how-iplc-shaped-cambodias-nea/). The plateau and mountain region of Cambodia is home to 22 Indigenous Peoples, including the Tum Puon, Phnong, Kroeng, Kui, Prove, and Charay. Together, they represent nearly 88% of the country’s total Indigenous population and play a key role in shaping how natural resources are used, protected, and passed on to future generations. Their traditional knowledge and cultural practices have more influence on resource use and conservation than any other groups. While this collective role is vital, a closer examination of communities provides a more nuanced understanding of the environmental and cultural concerns they face. 

3. A new report [Law of the Tiger: a comparative study of the laws governing tiger trafficking in 12 tiger range states](https://tigers.panda.org/reports/?19200441/law-of-the-tiger), reveals [critical legal gaps and inconsistencies that unless addressed would hinder efforts to counter the trafficking of tigers](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/first-ever-analysis-of-12-tiger-range-states-highlights-urgent-need-for-legislative-reform-to-reduce-threats-to-the-world-s-tigers) - undermining decades of conservation efforts and putting wild tigers at risk. The report is the most in-depth analysis of laws related to tiger trafficking ever undertaken across tiger range countries. It examines the extent to which national laws address the trafficking of tigers from source to sale. It draws on national legislation and policy and CITES obligations to assess each country’s readiness to tackle one of the world’s most enduring illegal trades in wildlife. There are an estimated 5,700 tigers left in the wild across 10 countries (Global Tiger Forum, 2025) with very low numbers in much of Southeast Asia including national extirpation in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam in the last 20 years. Previous research has shown that, between January 2000 and June 2022, more than 3,300 tigers were seized from illegal trade globally, 85% of them within tiger range countries, underscoring the continued failure to disrupt the trade routes supplying tiger products to international and domestic markets. Strong legal frameworks are a foundational part of addressing tiger trafficking, alongside the effective enforcement of these frameworks, engagement with local communities and the reduction of demand for tiger parts and products. The report found significant gaps and inconsistencies across multiple countries and provides recommendations for legislative reform and policy priorities for national governments, including to criminalize the full tiger trafficking chain (including digital transactions); clearly define “wildlife trade” to cover gaps such as advertising, display, brokerage, and possession; and create permanent, inter-agency enforcement units with full investigative powers to tackle illegal wildlife trade.

4. The [2025 Connected by Nature report](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/report-connected-by-nature-what-unites-americans) revealed that 3 in 4 Americans view nature as an essential part of America's cultural identity, with 64% of respondents believing it defines their region or state. The report shows that [Americans not only identify with nature but deem it essential to their well-being, with most agreeing that nature is critical for a steady food and water supply](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/majority-of-americans-view-nature-as-essential-to-their-cultural-identity-and-health). Nature also provides people across the country with emotional benefits, with 71% of respondents stating that they associate nature with relaxation and joy and 84% saying they love or like spending time in nature. The report also revealed that 84% of Americans are concerned about threats to nature—with 6 in 10 Americans being extremely or very concerned. They agree that addressing threats to nature is as important as addressing the wide range of other issues facing the world today. Further, 62% of Americans feel personally responsible for taking care of nature around them.

5. On 25 August 2025, the College of African Wildlife Management (MWEKA) in Tanzania and UNESCO [officially launched a collaboration initiative](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2809) that aims to support capacity development to strengthen conservation of Africa’s natural heritage. This new partnership is designed to help train the next generations of African heritage professionals through university-anchored programmes. 

6. The Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has [published](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/cites-secretariat-publishes-cop20-proposals-provisional-assessment-2025) its [provisional assessments of the 51 proposals to amend CITES Appendices I and II](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/notifications/E-Notif-2025-102.pdf) that will be considered at the 20th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CITES CoP20) taking place from 24 November to 5 December 2025 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. CITES Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction and prohibits commercial international trade, while Appendix II includes species for which the regulation of international trade is needed to ensure it remains sustainable. CITES also has an Appendix III, however, changes to the species included in Appendix III do not require the adoption of amendments at the CITES CoP. For CoP20, a total of [51 proposals](https://cites.org/eng/cop/20/amendment-proposals) were received, of which 39 concern fauna species and 12 concern flora species. A great variety of species, both biologically and geographically, are included in the proposals. Species proposed include okapi, hyenas, geckos, galliwasps, tarantulas, frogs, mollusks, songbirds, ginseng, palms, succulents, aloes, guggul, padouk and Brazilwood. Eleven of the fauna proposals are on commercially exploited aquatic species, which include a wide range of marine species including sea cucumbers, abalone, eels, sharks and rays.

7. [Empowering rangers, conserving elephants](https://cites.org/eng/news/empowering_rangers_conserving_elephants_cites_mike_programme_and_ecole_de_faune_de_garoua_unite_for_the_congo_basin): CITES MIKE Programme and Ecole de Faune de Garoua Unite for the Congo Basin. Wildlife crime, including the poaching of elephants for illegal trade in ivory, continues to pose a severe threat to biodiversity, the rule of law, and local livelihoods, in some parts of the world. Tackling this transnational challenge requires strong partnerships and sustained capacity-building, so as to enable frontline personnel and institutions to collect, share, and act on reliable data that underpins effective law enforcement and conservation strategies. This collaboration focuses on equipping rangers and park managers to collect and analyze elephant mortality data and monitor poaching trends. Participants learn to accurately record elephant mortality data - including the type and cause of death, detection method, age and sex of the elephant before death, and the presence or absence of tusks - engaging in practical exercises for using standardized protocols and applying crime scene management techniques that preserve evidence for court proceedings.

8. Agricultural expansion is a major driver of deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss. In recent years, over 90% of tropical deforestation has been either indirectly or directly driven by agriculture. Life on Earth relies on its forests – they help to regulate local and global climate and house an abundance of species. Agricultural drivers of deforestation include the production of many important commodities, from soy to cocoa – yet, when produced sustainably, these commodities can feed populations and support livelihoods. To safeguard the climate that we all depend on, and to continue to obtain these commodities, it is [key that production is free from deforestation and that trade is sustainable and respects the rights and needs of producers and forest-based communities](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-supports-implementation-of-european-union-deforestation-regulation). The EU law to ensure that trade tied to EU markets, EUDR, does not drive global deforestation or degradation. In practice, the EUDR requires companies to meet strict no-deforestation requirements to import and sell their products across EU markets, or to export them from the EU. The legislation applies to specific agricultural commodities, namely cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy and wood. This includes products derived from these items, for example, milk chocolate made from cocoa, beef from cattle, or a wetsuit made from rubber. 

9. The [GBIF task group on mobilization and use of biodiversity data for research and policy on human diseases](https://www.gbif.org/news/j6dXMQP9an4EnREeTT3oi/task-group-to-enhance-gbif-enabled-research-on-species-linked-to-human-diseases) has concluded its second and final term, [delivering major advances](https://www.gbif.org/news/5kEldoKNiT2XXSWUfQoMNp/task-group-on-biodiversity-data-for-human-diseases-concludes-work-delivers-data-publishing-guide) in the accessibility and use of biodiversity data to inform global responses to vector-borne diseases in the [Guide on publishing data on disease vectors, hosts and pathogens through biodiversity data platforms](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-mjj8-ng28). The task group’s work has strengthened the role of biodiversity data in global health policy and research. As the group concludes its formal work, its outputs will continue to support capacity building and data mobilization efforts on vector-borne diseases.

10. [GBIF funds four Capacity Enhancement Support Programme projects for 2025](https://www.gbif.org/news/6s2AzmmhLAAnshrGRngyXz/gbif-funds-four-cesp-projects-for-2025), to share more than €73,500 in funding. These selected projects are [Increasing the use of camera traps for biodiversity monitoring through translated materials in Latin America](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2025-014/), [Biodiversity data capacity building in Lithuania](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2025-002/), [Engaging the private sector for biodiversity data mobilization across Southern Africa](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2025-008/), and [Expanding FAIR biodiversity data practices in Central Asia via regional workshops and collaborative networks](https://www.gbif.org/project/CESP2025-004/). 

11. A new photographic guide documenting the rich coral habitat fauna off the coasts of Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal [has been released](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/new-photographic-guide-shines-light-on-coral-habitat-fauna-of-northwest-africa/) under the EAF-Nansen Programme, an Ocean Decade Action led by the Food and Agriculture Organization. The guide, [Coral habitat fauna of northwest Africa: A photographic guide to taxa identification](https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/cd4512en), provides the first comprehensive visual overview of marine species recorded in both shallow (less than 200 meters) and deep-water (greater than 200 meters) coral habitats in this region. The guide showcases 167 taxa, spanning hard corals, sea anemones, hydrozoans, bryozoans, sponges, polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians, and both bony and cartilaginous fishes. While not exhaustive, it is a critical step toward building baseline knowledge of the extraordinary biodiversity characterizing northwest Africa’s vulnerable marine ecosystems.

**Climate**
1. The [Global Heat Resilience Service](https://earthobservations.org/groups/global-heat-resilience-service) is increasingly well positioned to help address the estimated ~500,000 annual deaths linked to extreme heat, focusing on vulnerable urban communities. In May, the Global Heat Resilience Service was [formally accepted into the Post-2025 GEO Work Programme at the GEO Global Forum in Rome](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/building-urban-heat-resilience-global-heat-resilience-service-autumn-update), anchoring the initiative across GEO’s strategic areas: Climate, Energy & Urbanisation; One Health; and Disaster Resilience. This enables the initiative to respond directly to the UN Secretary-General’s Call to Action on extreme heat. The IPCC hazard-exposure-vulnerability framework to neighbourhood scales (100 - 250 m) to help define what Earth oberstaion, geospatial and socio-economic inputs are needed and how AI/modelling can integrate them to generate actionalbe local insights.

2. The inaugural pilot of UN Climate Change’s Capacity-Building for Negotiators (CB4N) initiative concluded in Nairobi, Kenya, this week marking an [important milestone in strengthening the voice of developing countries in global climate negotiations](https://unfccc.int/news/first-ever-pilot-of-capacity-building-for-climate-negotiators-initiative-concludes-successfully-in). Held from 17 to 19 September 2025, the training brought together nearly 25 negotiators from across Africa. AGNES’ extensive regional expertise and the RCC’s long-standing role in building regional negotiation capacity were instrumental in ensuring the success of the pilot. The pilot produced several key results: improved negotiation capacities for participants, the expansion of a network of regional facilitators, and the identification of Africa-specific priorities to guide the future roll-out of CB4N. Building on this success, the CB4N initiative, with continued leadership from RCCs and partners, is now ready to be replicated and scaled up in other countries.

3. Close to 100 countries — including nearly 40 Heads of State and Government — today announced, [committed to finalizing, or set out their commitment to implementing their new climate targets ahead of COP30](https://unfccc.int/news/momentum-gathers-towards-cop30-as-close-to-100-countries-signal-new-climate-targets) in Belém, Brazil this November. For the first time, several major economies including China – the world’s largest emitter – as well as Nigeria announced economy-wide emissions reduction targets covering all greenhouse gases and all sectors. Other nations detailed ambitious renewable energy goals, plans to curb methane emissions, strategies to safeguard forests, and measures to phase out fossil fuels. While today’s pledges mark progress, leaders acknowledged that ambition gaps remain to keep 1.5C in reach and deliver on finance and adaptation. Solutions Dialogues held throughout the week by the United Nations and Brazil highlighted that the technologies and tools needed to decarbonize energy, transport, and industry, protect forests, and strengthen resilience are already available. The challenge now is to accelerate scale.

4. UN Climate Change today published a [summary of feedback](https://unfccc.int/documents/649940) from the consultation process on the [‘five-year plan’ – a shared roadmap to organize and scale climate action through to 2030](https://unfccc.int/news/shaping-the-next-five-years-of-global-climate-action). Inputs come from both Parties and groups of Parties – representing more than 120 countries – as well as a wide range of non-Party stakeholders – businesses, cities, regions, communities, and organizations that play a vital role in advancing implementation efforts. The facts show the world is aligning with the Paris Agreement. Investment in renewables has increased ten-fold in ten years. The clean energy transition is booming across almost all major economies, and hit USD 2 trillion last year alone. Today, over 90% of new renewables cost less than the cheapest new fossil option.

5. Indigenous Peoples and local communities play a crucial role in protecting forests and the areas they manage tend to experience lower deforestation rates than other forests. In fact, forests managed by Indigenous Peoples in the Amazon Basin are some of the most effective carbon sinks on the planet. By maintaining these forests, they actively contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts. [New climate financing mechanisms are creating opportunities for Indigenous Peoples and local communities to generate revenue to support the long-term stewardship of their ancestral lands and forest resources](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/carbon-data-indigenous-communities-rfus/). However, communities often lack access to the data and tools required to quantify forest carbon fluxes (emissions from forest loss and disturbance, and removals due to plant growth) and communicate their contributions in ways recognized by these mechanisms. To help communities supply such data, Global Forest Watch (GFW) offers accessible, open-source maps and statistics on forest carbon fluxes. GFW’s interactive emissions, removals and net flux maps, with associated statistics, support action unlike any other forest carbon monitoring system. The maps are updated annually, allowing communities to tell the carbon story behind every pixel of forest.

**Oceans**
1. The theme of this year’s [World Maritime Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/maritime-day), “Our Ocean, Our Obligation, Our Opportunity,” is a stark reminder that all of us are stakeholders of the world’s oceans. Earth’s waters are home to millions of marine species, absorb emissions through blue carbon, and power the global economy by providing food, jobs, and trade routes. Cleaner, safer seas must be the standard, not the alternative. Planet Earth observation (EO) data and maritime insights can support the persistent monitoring of territorial waterways, assessment of biodiversity shifts, and detection of vessels in near-real time. Satellite imagery was used to monitor their areas of interest, identify irregularities, and verify incidents. [Enhanced maritime domain awareness](https://www.planet.com/pulse/safer-seas-with-earth-observation-for-maritime-insights/), with support from media reports, enabled defense agencies to make rapid, informed decisions and mitigate risks before they escalated.

2. Ocean science in action: [How ocean science helps to tackle climate change](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-how-ocean-science-helps-to-tackle-climate-change/). The ocean is responsible for about 50% of the oxygen produced on the planet, absorbs 30% of CO2 emissions, and captures 90% of excess heat. But this works both ways. Human activities cause seawater to warm and to become more acidic and polluted. The ocean is being severely damaged and with it its capacity to regulate the climate. 

3. We are all familiar with images of bleached coral reefs – these ghosts of once thriving habitats serve as a devastating example of the effects of climate change. More than half of the world’s reefs have already been lost since the 1950s because of rising temperatures and increasingly severe storms, as well as from activities such as overfishing, pollution and unsustainable development. With the loss of coral reefs comes the loss of thousands of marine species, as well as coastal protection, food security and livelihoods. However, there are efforts being made around the world to restore these vital ecosystems. In Indonesia, which holds the largest global share of reefs, promising steps have been made in developing an extensive and effective range of coral restoration programmes. One of the main strengths of these restoration initiatives is their solid grounding in local knowledge and lived experience. Another important factor which could further enhance their impact is Indonesia’s expertise in using ocean accounts – a way of [bringing together different kinds of ocean data](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/harnessing-the-power-of-data-for-marine-restoration) in one place. Let’s take a closer look at what ocean accounts are, and what makes them so useful in the context of marine restoration.

4. A [new study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads1592) released by Stanford University’s Center for Ocean Solutions has revealed that the Port State Measures Agreement — a global treaty designed to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) — is [boosting fisheries management efforts by making it harder for international fishing vessels to dodge inspections](https://globalfishingwatch.org/news-story/study-finds-global-treaty-curbing-illegal-fishing-yet-gaps-in-domestic-oversight-remain/). The study also warns that inconsistent standards applied to foreign and domestic fleets are potentially undermining the treaty’s effectiveness. The study also highlights a potential loophole: domestic fleets. While oversight of foreign vessels has tightened, ships landing their catch in their own flag State now account for a growing share of global port activity. According to researchers, in 2021, domestic vessels made up 66 percent of global port visits, up from 45 percent in 2015.

5. Despite being one of the most megadiverse regions in the world, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) face persistent challenges in building robust, sustainable marine biodiversity data infrastructures. Economic constraints, fragmented data landscapes, and limited technical capacity prevent the region from realising its full potential in global biodiversity data initiatives and hinder informed conservation policies at local, national, regional and global levels. [Thanks to the 10 000€ from POGO’s support, OBIS-LAC will take its first operational steps](https://www.obis.org/2025/09/02/pogo-obis-lac/), with the goal to boost the region’s capacity to contribute to global biodiversity platforms, better align with international conservation efforts such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as improve participation in major regional agreements, such as the Cartagena Convention.

6. Borders at sea, or maritime boundaries, are the politically defined lines that partition the ocean and its resources into different national jurisdictions. On the map of [Ocean Health Index (OHI) global scores](https://oceanhealthindex.org/news/maritime-boundaries/%E2%80%9C/global-scores/%E2%80%9D), each region has a distinct boundary along its coastline that indicates the sovereign waters of that nation. This boundary is referred to as the Exclusive Economic Zone, a 200 nautical mile area off a nation's coastline where the state has jurisdiction over coastal resources. More specifically, it’s where a nation has the right to explore, manage, conserve, and exploit natural resources in the sea and seabed. While the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas made great strides in unifying global consensus around maritime boundaries, the EEZ was not a one-size-fits-all solution. There can be border disputes or disagreements between political actors over the precise location or ownership of a particular geographic boundary. In the OHI framework, they show up as disputed territories, or regions shaded grey on the global score map. As climate change continues to drive our ecosystems towards extremes, these border disputes are only going to increase in frequency. Sea-level rise is already beginning to physically redraw coastlines, changing the baselines from which the maritime zones are measured and thus their overall size. Because scores are calculated within the framework of EEZs, the implications of shifting maritime boundaries for the Ocean Health Index are significant. Any shift in boundaries reshapes how we measure a nation’s performance. A country’s apparent progress or decline may reflect not just ecological realities but also the way its maritime borders are defined. In this sense, the fluidity of boundaries directly influences our understanding of ocean health and stewardship, reminding us that [the environment cannot be divorced from the political and social frameworks in which it is embedded](https://oceanhealthindex.org/news/maritime-boundaries/).

**Transformative Change**
1. [A process of possibility, urgency and hope](https://www.besnet.world/a-process-of-possibility-urgency-and-hope-karen-obrien-on-transformative-change/). Transformative change, as defined by the IPBES assessment, is a fundamental, system-wide reorganization across technological, economic and social dimensions, including our paradigms, goals and values. The process of transformative change involves deliberate shifts in views (how we see the world), structures (how we organize society) and practices (how we live and relate to Nature and each other). It’s not about fixing symptoms; it’s about addressing the root causes of biodiversity loss, climate change and inequality. The science is clear: we are approaching irreversible tipping points in ecosystems that sustain life on Earth as we know it. The IPBES Transformative Change Assessment emphasizes that delaying systemic action increases the risks and costs of inaction and jeopardizes the achievement of the 2025 Vision for Biodiversity. But urgency doesn’t mean despair. It means acting decisively while we still can, knowing that the window for meaningful change is narrow, but not yet closed.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Trees for the Future (TREES)](http://trees.org/) has published its [revised Forest Garden Training Manual](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/forest-garden-technical-manual), a comprehensive resource [designed to support farmer-driven, climate-resilient agroforestry systems worldwide](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/un-decade-flagship-trees-future-releases-science-backed-farmer-driven-guide-climate-resilient). This new Technical Manual for Trainers is a practical, science-backed guide, built on more than 30 years of TREES’ field experience, co-created with farmers and other sector experts, and shaped by decades of research, trial, and error. It reflects the same knowledge TREES uses every day to train staff and partner farmers. Through locally led training, TREES works with farmers to transform degraded land into thriving, sustainable farms. Since 1989, more than 63,000 farming families across sub-Saharan Africa have restored over 100,000 acres into productive landscapes that function as carbon sinks and abundant food sources. Each Forest Garden grows a diverse mix of crops, allowing farmers to feed their families, improve nutrition, and generate stable income.

**News and updates about applications**
1. Bolstering biodiversity's backbone: [VertNet launches hosted portal](https://www.gbif.org/news/7fLuxT8pP4aYu5pucjNyt9/bolstering-biodiversitys-backbone-vertnet-launches-hosted-portal). The latest GBIF node, [VertNet](https://www.vertnet.org/) expands global access to open biodiversity data and training resources. The new hosted portal streamlines VertNet’s information technology operations by providing a flexible, user-friendly platform where users can access, visualize, map and interact with global vertebrate data. The transition to a GBIF hosted portal brings several new capabilities for VertNet users, including automated data indexing, access to images and other digital media assets, higher resolution mapping and search functions and more. Integration with GBIF infrastructure also enables the generation of DOIs for every download and query, improving citation tracking across the global biodiversity informatics ecosystem.

2. At this year's international gathering of volcanologists, there was a [growing push for low-cost instruments to improve volcano forecasting](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/volcanologists-explore-turning-volcano-risks-into-opportunities). For scientists in high-risk, low-resource places like Goma, affordable and reliable tools can mean the difference between safety and exposure. A standout example was a $75 modular camera developed at the University of Geneva. Despite its low price, it can track volcanic plumes, detect ash and gases, and support eruption forecasts. I saw it firsthand in Riccardo Simionato’s lab, where we discussed its potential use for monitoring Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, two of Africa’s most active volcanoes.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [Principles of Open Science Monitoring](https://open-science-monitoring.org/principles/) are now online, offering a global, aspirational framework for how Open Science can be tracked and supported through inclusive, transparent, and responsible monitoring approaches. The publication responds to the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, which called for the creation of robust frameworks to support national and international efforts to make science more open, inclusive, and impactful. The key takeaways: Monitoring should be well-defined, relevant, and adaptable to diverse research contexts. Indicators must be meaningful for planning and policy, developed through participatory processes, and applicable across a range of disciplines and stakeholder needs, supporting evidence-informed decisions without enforcing a one-size-fits-all model. Monitoring systems should rely on open infrastructures, use open-source tools, and prioritise public documentation and data provenance. Indicators should be traceable and reproducible, using quality-assured input data and shared methodologies to support transparency, trust, and reusability. Monitoring should be reviewed regularly, and never used in isolation to rank individuals. Initiatives should be embedded within a culture of learning, improvement, and environmental responsibility. Indicators must reflect the diversity of disciplines, knowledge systems, and stakeholders, and be developed in dialogue with the communities they aim to represent. The Principles are non-prescriptive and intended to evolve over time. They encourage shared ownership, long-term planning, and practical alignment with local needs, recognising that robust monitoring must balance comparability with contextual sensitivity.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. At the cutting edge of science, breakthroughs happen when disciplines connect. Earth and health sciences are coming together like never before, using the power of satellites, models, algorithms, cloud platforms and artificial intelligence to tackle today’s most pressing health risks. [12 Innovative Earth observation applications for health in the Americas](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/12-innovative-earth-observation-applications-for-health-in-the-americas), including: 1. Developing a malaria early warning system: harnessing satellite data to build predictive models for malaria in data-scarce regions. 2. West Nile virus forecasting in Louisiana and South Dakota. 9. Examining the impacts of greenspace on children's sleep, while also considering the effects of weather and air quality.

2. Extreme events, rising seas and record-high temperatures are accelerating, but impacts fall unevenly: Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) face outsized risk from sea-level rise, coastal hazards, habitat loss, and erosion. This is despite minimal contributions to emissions. [Strengthening adaptive capacity in these countries is therefore a priority – and Earth Intelligence has a key role to play](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/how-earth-intelligence-supports-climate-adaptation-for-small-islands-and-the-world-s-least-developed-countries). For SIDS and LDCs, smart adaptation starts with Earth Intelligence: timely, trusted insights from Earth observations and climate services. This means in situ measurements (tide gauges, drifting and moored buoys, coastal radars) deliver real-time, local readings of sea level, waves and temperature; satellite remote sensing adds consistent, coast-to-coast coverage; and fusion of data and tools turns raw measurements into decision support: coastal risk screening, early warning, and design standards for ports, roads, clinics and nature-based solutions.

**Biodiversity**
1. The Bahamas is gearing up to [launch](https://cites.org/eng/news/caricom-and-cites-secretariats-partner-to-launch-electronic-cites-permitting-system-in-the-bahamas) an [electronic Permitting System](https://cites.org/eng/prog/eCITES) to modernise the regulation of international trade in wildlife, enhancing efforts to combat wildlife crime and ensuring the legality and sustainability of international trade in wild species.

2. [Accurate, reliable data is essential for monitoring biodiversity and tracking progress towards global targets](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/a-boost-for-biodiversity-data), as well as allowing private sector actors to measure their nature-related risks and impacts. IBAT is a user-friendly platform that provides access to the world’s most authoritative global biodiversity data. IBAT provides access to three of the world's most authoritative global biodiversity datasets: The World Database on Protected Areas; The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; and The World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These foundational datasets are used in IBAT for early biodiversity risk screening, setting goals and measuring progress towards global biodiversity targets such as those in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. They help build a more complete picture of the state of nature globally, enhancing understanding of threats to biodiversity and driving tangible conservation action. They also support businesses and financial institutions in understanding the potential impact of their operations on the natural world, assessing their dependencies on biodiversity, and aligning with regulatory and disclosure requirements.

3. A [wave of pledges to protect marine life](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/a-wave-of-pledges-to-protect-marine-life-outcomes-from-the-third-un-ocean-conference): outcomes from the third UN Ocean Conference. The ocean both contains and preserves life. It is home to between 500,000 and 10 million species, from krill to blue whales. This uncertainty over total species numbers is linked to the ocean’s vastness and depth. The ocean itself plays a vital part in sustaining economies, societies and life on land. Yet drivers of degradation like unsustainable fishing practices and pollution lead marine life to decline. A greater scientific understanding of these species enables stronger protection for marine biodiversity. Human impacts on the ocean, such as overfishing, coastal development and pollution often disrupt the delicate balance required to sustain productive and resilient marine ecosystems. The creation of marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used as an effective means for conserving, restoring and sustainably using biodiversity in the ocean. The UN Ocean Conference saw many pledges to develop new MPAs. Ocean action requires financial investment from both the public and private sectors. To this end, the European Union made a pledge of EUR one billion at the conference to finance marine science, including research on sustainable fishing practices. Aside from simply advancing knowledge, this funding aims to develop strategies for small island states that are among those most affected by climate change and biodiversity loss. 

4. Companies depend on nature, yet ecosystems across the world are being degraded. All businesses rely on healthy and functioning landscapes for their direct operations, or for sourcing raw materials. The most exposed to these dependencies and related risks are those with operations focusing on primary production, or whose supply chains rely heavily on ecosystem goods and services. Landscape-level approaches (LLAs) utilize a multi-stakeholder approach to reconcile competing [social, environmental and business goals in a landscape](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/combining-landscape-and-supply-chain-approaches-to-protect-nature-2). Sustainability goals across all these areas are agreed through consensus. LLAs consider how different actors across a landscape, including local communities or businesses, weave together and impact nature, therefore offering a holistic approach for the sustainable management of landscapes. There is a strong business case for extending LLAs beyond agri-food operations, to sectors that are working in landscapes or have influence over them through their supply chains. 

5. Achieving the ambitious global targets set by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework will require a substantial increase in the mobilization of financial resources from all sources: international and domestic, public and private. Closing the global biodiversity finance gap – estimated at USD 700 billion per year – calls for a systemic shift in financial flows. This was reflected in the landmark decision on resource mobilization reached at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD COP16). Governments alone cannot meet this challenge. The private finance sector (including banks, asset managers, insurers and impact investors) can help to play a pivotal role, both in mobilizing resources for biodiversity and especially in aligning mainstream financial flows with biodiversity goals. A [new report by UNEP-WCMC](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-finance-institutions-are-key-to-delivering-on-nbsaps) explores options for policymakers and financial institutions to collaborate in advancing the private finance sector's role in the implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, known as NBSAPs.

6. UNEP-WCMC [launched](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-2023-2024-impact-report) their [2023-2024 impact report](https://impactreport.unep-wcmc.org/en), showcasing the ways in which the Centre has brought about action for nature over the last two years. As the report notes from the outset, our impacts are myriad. They range from developing high-profile reports that inform decisions on a global scale, to guiding negotiations at international meetings, to providing in-person support through training and workshops.

7. UNESCO and its partners [released](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2792) a [new report](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000394614) which shows the extent to which extractive industries are encroaching upon UNESCO World Heritage sites, and emphasizes the critical role investors can play in assessing their risk exposure and influencing extractive companies’ practices. The data and analysis in the report help investors identify and manage the risks, aligning their investment decisions with global heritage protection commitments.

8. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has published its [Review of the state of world marine fishery resources](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/ac6d51bb-5e01-4117-b1c6-cee61d430db0), the most detailed global assessment of marine fish stocks to date. Covering 2,570 individual fish stocks, the report [provides the latest data on the fisheries sector and key trends related to overfishing and sustainable management](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2025/07/04/fao-fishery-resources-report-six-takeaways). The report shows that there are significant regional variations in stocks fished sustainably: in Antarctica, 100% of stocks are fished within biologically sustainable levels, while overfishing is a serious problem in the Southeast Pacific and Eastern Central Atlantic where less than half of stocks are fished sustainably. Especially tuna fisheries are high-performing in terms of sustainable management. Global trends underscore persistent threats to sharks, both from targeted fishing as well as from bycatch. Additionally, the report found that only 29% of deepsea species' assessed stocks are fished sustainably. 

9. IUCN Save Our Species and the European Commission [opened the call for proposals](https://iucnsos.org/new-call-for-proposals-european-fund-for-youth-action-on-pollinators/) for the [European Fund for Youth Action on Pollinators](https://www.iucnsos.org/initiative/european-fund-for-youth-action-on-pollinators/). Through this fund, youth-led civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations which have a youth chapter and are active in pollinator conservation in the EU and young individuals are eligible to receive grants to create pollinator-friendly habitats, raise awareness of pollinator importance, improve our understanding of threats, and develop innovative solutions to conserve pollinator populations. Projects funded under these two calls can run up to 15 months and must be implemented within EU countries (EU overseas countries, territories and outermost regions are not eligible). Grants of up to 70,000 EUR will be awarded to youth-led organisations and organisations with a youth chapter and are active in pollinator conservation in the EU, and grants of up to 15,000 EUR will be awarded to individual EU citizens based in the country of project implementation, between 18 and 35 years of age.

10. Another call for proposals by IUCN Save Our Species, under the [European Invasive Alien Species Rapid-Response Fund](https://iucnsos.org/initiative/european-invasive-alien-species-rapid-response-fund/), is [open now](https://iucnsos.org/new-call-for-proposal-european-rapid-response-fund-for-invasive-alien-species/). Funded by the European Union, this initiative provides targeted, fast-track funding to support rapid actions to address the threat of invasive alien species (IAS) in Europe. It is designed to stop small incursions before they escalate into major biodiversity and economic crises. The call is open to organisations operating in the European Union, EU overseas countries and territories are not eligible, except for the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira.   

11. A [new UK government report](https://www.imarest.org/resource/marine-mammal-monitoring-methods-technologies-and-opportunities-for-innovation.html) unveils how [cutting-edge technology, genetic science, and artificial intelligence are poised to transform marine mammal monitoring and conservation](https://oceandecade.org/news/imarest-and-defra-spotlight-breakthroughs-in-marine-mammal-monitoring/). The report draws on the IMarEST’s expert global community to highlight cutting-edge tools and methodologies that are transforming how scientists study and protect whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals. Breakthrough developments include the use of drones, passive acoustic monitoring, and thermal imaging, along with game-changing tools such as environmental DNA, satellite and drone imagery analysis. Advances in ‘omics’ — the study of genes, RNA transcripts, proteins, and metabolic products — also show significant promise. The report emphasises that these innovations are unlocking physiological data that was once thought unattainable, driving a new era in our understanding of marine mammal health and the impacts of human activity. However, it also calls for sustained investment in marine research and data science, in line with the UK Marine Strategy and international frameworks such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

12. The recently published paper – [Tackling temporary names in WoRMS: interim solutions for the taxonomic impediment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12526-025-01559-4?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20250805&utm_content=10.1007%2Fs12526-025-01559-4) – gives insights into the general topic of temporary names, how WoRMS can tackle these, and why doing so is important at the time of the triple planetary crises of biodiversity loss, climate change and pollution. Tackling temporary names in WoRMS: interim solutions for the taxonomic impediment – above all formulates practical recommendations, including providing criteria clarifying which names can be selected for entry and how they should be entered in a standardised way, not only into WoRMS but also into taxonomic databases in general. WoRMS does not expect editors to capture all existing temporary or informal names. The paper indicates that only the entry of Type 2 temporary names will be considered. [Type 2 temporary names are those that have been confirmed as new to science in a scientific publication, but which currently lack a formal description and a Linnean binominal name according to the relevant nomenclatural code. The expectation is that these Type 2 temporary names will eventually be formally taxonomically described, so their name relationships can be tracked through synonymy in WoRMS. Although this might only seem like a small step forward, the broad adoption of these guidelines and recommendations concerning temporary names supports the broader, robust integration of informal and formal taxonomies into global taxonomic databases.

13. [New CITES documentary short film celebrates the rangers conserving Ghana's wildlife](https://cites.org/eng/news/film-release-guardians-of-the-giants-mole-national-park-ghana-2025) for World Ranger Day 2025, available to stream in English, French and Spanish. Guardians of Giants brings viewers into the world of Mole’s rangers – from early morning briefings, to long patrols across rugged and hot terrain. The film captures the courage, discipline and unwavering dedication of rangers on the frontlines of conservation.

14. Thanks to satellite data, we know how much forest the world is losing, and where. But that’s only part of the story. Unless we know what’s driving tree cover loss, it’s impossible to know if it’s permanent or temporary; what the impacts are for people, nature and climate; and the solutions to keep forests standing. That’s where new data comes in. It [reveals that 34% of tree cover losses worldwide from 2001-2024 were likely the result of permanent land use change](https://www.wri.org/insights/forest-loss-drivers-data-trends), meaning trees won’t grow back naturally. This percentage nearly doubles in tropical primary rainforests, with 61% of loss likely associated with permanent land use change. However, the drivers of tree cover loss — and their long-term impacts on forests — vary widely by region and require different solutions. Better understanding them can help aid in the conservation of these critical ecosystems.

15. [The Latest Data Confirms: Forest Fires Are Getting Worse](https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires?utm_medium=referral+&utm_source=GFWBlog&utm_campaign=GFWBlog%22target=%22_blank). Using [data](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.825190/full) from researchers at the University of Maryland, recently updated to cover the years 2001-2024, we calculated that forest fires now burn more than twice as much tree cover each year as they did two decades ago. This increase in fire activity has been starkly visible in recent years. Record-setting blazes are becoming the norm, with four of the five worst years for global forest fires occurring since 2020. 2024 was the most extreme year for forest fires on record, with at least 13.5 million hectares of forest burned — an area roughly the size of Greece. This surpassed the previous record of 11.9 million hectares, set in 2023, by about 13%. And some estimates suggest the true toll of 2024's fires may have been even higher.

16. Europe’s ancient trees are home to a little-known but [vital cohort of pollinators](https://iucnsos.org/protecting-europes-veteran-tree-hoverflies/). Veteran tree hoverflies that depend on old, decaying wood to survive are vital to maintaining the health and resilience of forest ecosystems throughout Europe. However, many of these species are under threat of extinction. The [Veteran Tree Hoverflies Conservation Action Plan 2023–2030](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/89c55aac-f9e6-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) was developed as part of the European Commission’s broader efforts to protect pollinators, following the revised EU Pollinators Initiative. It addresses the urgent need to protect species whose populations are plummeting due to habitat loss, climate change, and unsustainable land management. Habitat destruction is the most pressing threat, especially the removal of veteran trees for agriculture, forestry, and urban development. Invasive species, poor forest management, and increasingly frequent wildfires driven by climate change also contribute to their decline. Climate change poses a dual risk: accelerating tree loss and disrupting flowering and breeding cycles that hoverflies depend on. Combined, these threats are putting extraordinary pressure on already fragile populations.

17. [Global Tiger Day: Securing the future of tigers with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities at the heart](https://iucnsos.org/global-tiger-day-2025/). These communities have lived alongside tigers for generations, stewarding landscapes that sustain not only wildlife, but also water, forests and climate regulation for all. As we mark this day, the message is clear: securing a future for tigers means placing IPLCs at the heart of conservation. 

18. IUCN Save Our Species has partnered with the TUI Care Foundation on two community-based conservation projects in Namibia and Cambodia. By [linking species conservation with nature-based tourism](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-partners-with-the-tui-care-foundation-to-protect-threatened-species-through-nature-based-tourism-projects/), these initiatives aim to safeguard threatened wildlife while supporting local and Indigenous communities to benefit from sustainable livelihoods. While the conservancies play a critical role monitoring threatened species and managing their habitat, they face major challenges, including lack of resources and livelihood opportunities. Thanks to the partnership, IUCN Save Our Species is supporting a three-year scheme to strengthen the conservancies’ capacities for biodiversity conservation through the development of sustainable, nature-based tourism projects. Sustainable tourism will create job opportunities for locals, as wildlife guides, hospitality managers and tourism operators. This in turn, supports greater environmental awareness on the importance of the Conservancies’ work and scales-up resources for the participation of local communities to participate and benefit from nature conservation. 

19. [Six takeaways](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2025/07/04/fao-fishery-resources-report-six-takeaways) from the FAO's latest report about sustainable fishing '[Review of the state of world marine fishery resources](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/ac6d51bb-5e01-4117-b1c6-cee61d430db0)'. 1. There are significant regional variations in stocks fished sustainably. 2. Not all species are equal - tuna sets the pace. Data shows that 87 percent of tuna and tuna-like stocks are sustainable (i.e., not overfished), or when weighted by their volume of production, 99 percent of total tuna landings came from sustainable sources (i.e., from stocks that are not overfished). 3. Updated methodology makes for improved assessment methods and collaborations. However, it’s worth noting that the total catch represented from assessed stocks has only increased slightly, from 72% of global marine fishery landings in 2021 to 74.2% in the same year. And the resulting classifications of fish stocks into the categories ‘sustainably exploited’ and ‘not sustainably exploited’ (previously, ‘overfished’) are remarkably like those under the earlier approach and yield similar figures. 4. Bycatch concerns – Highly migratory sharks remain vulnerable. 5. Kept in the dark – we have limited knowledge around deep sea species. Sitting near the bottom of the sustainability rankings, the report found that only 29% of deep-sea species’ assessed stocks are fished sustainably. 6. Overfishing has stabilised (for now). With 35.5 percent of stocks classified as overfished, the report suggests that overfishing globally has stabilised.

20. [How fireflies are turning Japanese youth into stewards for nature](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-fireflies-are-turning-japanese-youth-stewards-nature). Every year, hundreds of youngsters spend a summer evening hunting along the canals that crisscross the Japanese city of Kanazawa. They are on the lookout for blinking points of light that reveal their target: fireflies. Youth engagement is central to Kanazawa’s strategy to preserve and restore the city’s natural and cultural heritage, including its historic canals and gardens. Its success has caught the eye of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which has [selected it as a model for other municipalities looking to restore their urban ecosystems](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/generation-restoration-cities). 

**Climate**
1. [Counting the costs of drought](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/counting-the-costs-of-drought). Drought is fast becoming one of the most pressing societal and environmental challenges of our time. A new report by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), [Drought Hotspots Around the World 2023–2025](https://www.unccd.int/resources/publications/drought-hotspots-around-world-2023-2025), highlights the increasing severity, frequency and geographic spread of droughts worldwide. The report identifies a broad swathe of regions as drought hotspots – from the Horn of Africa and the Middle East to the Mediterranean, South Asia and Central America. These regions are facing acute water shortages, crop failures, population displacement and rising food insecurity. Drought exposes and exacerbates underlying social, environmental and economic vulnerabilities. Its impacts are far-reaching and long-term: for example, when faced with uninhabitable conditions and food and water shortages, communities are often forced to migrate, which has knock-on effects for health and education.

2. The EU Cities Mission has [launched a call for expressions of interest](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/call-twin-cities-join-cities-mission-twinning-learning-programme-2025-06-25_en) for a [new Twinning Learning Programme](https://netzerocities.eu/twin-cities-mission-cities-2025/), designed to support the [EU Mission Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en). Participating twin cities will engage in structured peer learning and hands-on collaboration from November 2025 to November 2026. The programme aims to enable peer-to=peer learning and mutual inspiration by focusing on concrete climate actions and jointly addressing implementation barriers identified by both Mission cities and twin cities; support the replication of effective climate actions through co-creating a tailored replication plan for twin cities; and build long-lasting partnership between Mission and twin cities beyond the duration of the programme. The call is open for [applications](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/NZCTwinning) until the 12th of September (17:00 CET) to cities not currently part of the 112 Mission Cities, based in EU Member States or Horizon Europe-associated countries.

3. The European Commission has [unveiled](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/climate-change-and-public-health-new-roadmap-research-and-innovation-reduce-risks-2025-06-05_en) an ambitious [Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on health and climate change](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/616cce9c-39e5-11f0-8a44-01aa75ed71a1). The Strategic Agenda is a roadmap for organisations that fund research and innovation, providing clarity for planning future priorities. The agenda covers research priorities in the areas of: the impacts of climate change on health, the adaptation of people and healthcare systems to climate change, climate mitigation by the health sector, implementing science into policymaking, as well as several other horizontal themes. The priorities are applicable to different stages of research and innovation; from the early, fundamental stages to the uptake phase. Moreover, the SRIA also points out the potential societal benefits that each of the research priorities can deliver and ensures that an equity lens remains central to research and innovation efforts. 

4. [Protecting and restoring forests are essential for curbing climate change](https://www.wri.org/insights/secondary-forest-carbon-removal). But while efforts often focus on conserving mature forests and planting new trees (both of which are badly needed), a critical piece of the puzzle is often overlooked: managing naturally regrowing forests to increase the carbon they remove. [New research by The Nature Conservancy, WRI and partners](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5) shows that naturally regenerating "secondary forests" (which have regrown after being cleared by harvests, severe fires, agriculture or other disturbances) could be especially powerful for fighting climate change. It is the first to show where, and at what ages, they can have the biggest impact. Secondary forests between 20 and 40 years old can remove carbon from the atmosphere up to 8 times faster per hectare than new natural growth — if they are allowed to reach those older ages. The catch is that many secondary forests don't regrow for this long, whether due to human activity (such as clearing or harvest) or climate-related disturbances (like fires or pests). These findings highlight that countries may be underestimating the value of naturally regenerating secondary forests in their climate reporting — and that protecting them, or encouraging their regrowth for longer periods, offers untapped opportunities for climate action.

5. Forest fires have become a harsh new reality for millions globally, with their impacts felt near and far. Over the last few years, fires have destroyed billions of dollars in property, displaced thousands of people and coated cities in choking smoke, causing deadly air quality. It's no coincidence that fires are becoming more intense as the planet warms. Fires need hot, dry conditions to ignite and spread. While fire is a natural part of some forest ecosystems, climate change is making forest fires worse, and vice-versa — creating a [vicious "climate-fire feedback loop"](https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-fire-feedback-loop-explained). Rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions lead to hotter, drier conditions. This makes it easier for fires to spark and grow. Worsening fires release larger amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere as trees and plants burn — further accelerating climate change and perpetuating the cycle.

6. Forests have historically acted as a reliable planetary thermostat. They regulate Earth’s temperature by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and locking it in trees, roots and soil — carbon that is emitted if trees are cut down. In a typical year, forests and other vegetation absorb roughly 30% of the carbon that humans emit from burning fossil fuels — a vital climate service performed at virtually no cost by trees around the world, from tropical rainforests to temperate and boreal forests. New analysis of data from WRI’s Global Forest Watch (GFW) and Land & Carbon Lab reveals that [extreme fires caused forests to absorb far less carbon than usual in 2023 and 2024](https://www.wri.org/insights/forest-carbon-sink-shrinking-fires-deforestation), weakening their cooling effect. During those years, forests absorbed only a quarter of the carbon dioxide they do in an average year. 2023 marked the lowest “forest carbon sink” in over two decades when considering the loss of trees’ stored carbon and greenhouse gases caused by burning.

7. The [leadership of Indigenous Peoples is essential to a liveable, climate-resilient future](https://unfccc.int/news/indigenous-worldviews-strengthening-climate-resilience). Their knowledge systems, rooted in stewardship, interdependence and care for all life, have guided – and continue to guide – communities through environmental change for millennia. Across the world, Indigenous Peoples are responding to climate impacts with ingenuity and foresight. Grounded in lived experience and sustained through generations, Indigenous ways of living are diverse, adaptive, relational and deeply ecological, connected to land and culture. These are dynamic frameworks for resilience. As ambition under the Paris Agreement accelerates – in particular through the Global Goal on Adaptation – Indigenous Peoples are increasingly recognized not just as participants in climate policymaking, but as pathfinders. Their distinct and diverse worldviews offer valuable insights into what it truly means to be adapted: living in harmony with ecosystems, upholding intergenerational responsibility, and restoring balance.

8. Almost ten years ago, the Paris Agreement changed the politics of climate change. It moved away from a system of top-down targets and introduced a more flexible framework based on national plans, voluntary commitments and shared goals. This approach opened space for cities, regions, businesses, investors, and civil society to contribute more directly. It also revitalized international cooperation and helped broaden the base of global climate action. Since then, climate action has expanded dramatically. Companies have set net zero targets and cities have launched local adaptation and resilience programmes. Indigenous communities have restored damaged ecosystems, and financial institutions have begun shifting capital. Across sectors and regions, the number of initiatives has grown to support national policymaking. But the [experience of the past decade has shown that while the framework has broadened participation and resulted in significant progress, it has not resolved the need for stronger coordination, clearer delivery, and more consistent support to accelerate even further action in all corners of the world](https://unfccc.int/news/a-decade-after-paris-new-work-programme-drives-stronger-more-coordinated-climate-action). Many initiatives continue to operate in isolation, with limited mechanisms to understand collective progress or connect efforts across sectors.

A China-led international deep-sea cooperative exploration project, the [Global Hadal Exploration Programme](https://oceandecade.org/actions/global-hadal-exploration-programme-ghep/) has [won](https://oceandecade.org/news/china-steps-up-deep-sea-science-role-with-un-backed-oceans-exploration-project/) United Nations approval, paving the way for Beijing's increased participation in global science and technology governance. Under the Ocean Decade framework, a global research centre will be established to run annual crewed expeditions into the hadal zone, which lies within the oceanic trenches.

2. The [DAN.PADI Ocean Literacy Project](https://oceanliteracy.edu.daneurope.org/index) has been [officially recognised as an Ocean Decade Action by UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission](https://oceandecade.org/news/unesco-endorses-ocean-literacy-project-by-leading-diving-organisations/), a significant recognition of the scientific value and social relevance of the programme. The DAN.PADI Ocean Literacy Project is an international educational initiative, designed to raise awareness and empower younger generations to become stewards of the ocean. Through a dynamic e-learning experience, its mission is to make ocean knowledge accessible and engaging by combining science, sustainability and storytelling. It consists of four core learning modules: citizen science, plastic pollution, climate change and underwater archaeology. With the official endorsement, the programme is now expanding its original scope to provide wider access to ocean education for people of all ages, backgrounds and nationalities. 

3. [Ocean science in action: how global cooperation helps to advance ocean science](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-how-global-cooperation-helps-to-advance-ocean-science/). Ocean science is central to all facets of sustainable development and forms the foundation for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, from protecting marine ecosystems and eradicating hunger to building resilient coastal communities. Four success stories are highlighted: 1. The UNESCO-IOC [CoastWAVE project](https://oceandecade.org/actions/enhance-coastal-resilience-to-sea-level-hazards/) funded by the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations helps coastal communities better anticipate and mitigate the impacts of tsunamis, saving lives and protecting livelihoods. The project also reinforces early warning systems by expanding regional sea‑level monitoring and installing alert sirens in at‑risk areas. 2. The [ECOP Programme](https://www.ecopdecade.org/): empowering early career ocean professionals means addressing three critical gaps in ocean science at once: persistent generational, gender and geographic imbalances. 3. The [Global Ocean Oxygen Decade](https://oceandecade.org/actions/global-ocean-oxygen-decade/), a Decade Programme which aims to advance research on ocean deoxygenation, and provide scientific advice for decision-making from local to global scales.  4. The [OceanTeacher Global Academy](https://oceandecade.org/actions/oceanteacher-global-academy-building-capacity-and-accelerated-technology-transfer-for-the-ocean-decade/): helping to equip communities and countries with the skills they need to make impactful ocean decisions and policies. 

4. Despite decades of ocean exploration, humans still lack basic answers to one of the most fundamental ecological questions: [where is marine life found, and why](https://oceandecade.org/news/mapping-the-gaps-new-global-assessment-reveals-stark-biases-in-ocean-biodiversity-data/)? A [new study published in Communications Earth & Environment](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02442-7) highlights how uneven our knowledge of ocean biodiversity really is. By systematically processing nearly 19 million records from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, the study reveals that global marine biodiversity data from below 30m are heavily biased towards shallow waters (50% of benthic records come from just the shallowest 1% of the seafloor), the Northern Hemisphere (over 75% of records), and vertebrates, namely fish. The authors urge future sampling to focus on four key priorities: the deep ocean (>1500 m), the southern hemisphere, invertebrate taxa and remote areas beyond national jurisdiction. 

5. [Citizens collecting vital ocean data to protect surf breaks](https://oceandecade.org/news/citizens-collecting-vital-ocean-data-to-protect-surf-breaks/) with a new initiative: [Surfer Scientists](https://oceandecade.org/actions/surfer-scientists/) which aims to address three Ocean Decade Challenges: 2. Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity; 7. Sustainably expand the Global Ocean Observing System and 10. Restore society's relationship with the ocean. With over 35 million surfers worldwide, the potential to capture temperature, bathymetry, tidal and water quality data is immense. And, people are having fun collecting data while on the water, knowing the impact it could make in their communities.

6. The [Deep Ocean Microbiomes and Ecosystems (DOME) program](https://oceandecade.org/actions/deep-ocean-microbiomes-and-ecosystems-dome/) was officially [launched](https://oceandecade.org/news/shanghai-based-program-aims-to-unlock-the-oceans-secrets/) at the end of June, and aims to advance research into microbial diversity and contribute to responding to climate change. DOME explores the taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity of deep-sea microbes through the lens of marine ecosystems and their responses and interactions with climate change. 

7. A [new research study 'Future climate projections in the global coastal ocean'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661125000850?via%3Dihub), published in the Progress in Oceanography journal, has [forecast the impacts of climate change on the world's coastal oceans to the end of the century](https://oceandecade.org/news/major-global-study-on-future-climate-threats-to-coastal-oceans/). The study assesses how climate change will alter ocean temperature, salinity, sea level and currents across the global coastal ocean - regions which host diverse ecosystems and are home to more than a third of the world's population. Using advanced climate models and high-resolution data, the study projects significant warming in coastal ocean regions by 2100 under high-emission scenarios, with associated changes in salinity and ocean dynamics. These transformations are expected to have profound consequences for biodiversity, fisheries, coastal communities and the wider climate system. The study highlights how coastal areas are particularly vulnerable due to their shallow waters and proximity to land-based impacts, such as freshwater discharge and pollution. Changes in coastal ocean conditions could affect key industries such as fisheries and offshore energy, while also exacerbating risks such as sea-level rise and coastal erosion.

8. The UN Decade of Ocean Science [endorsed 43 new ocean science initiatives](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-solutions-in-action-43-new-initiatives-endorsed-by-the-ocean-decade/), which topics range from advancing marine disaster prevention, driving sustainable ocean planning and ocean leadership across Africa, and building knowledge and capacity for ocean literacy. 

9. From Berlin to Vancouver and Marseille to Nice, a powerful wave of change is gaining momentum through [WE ARE OCEAN](https://oceandecade.org/actions/artport_we-are-ocean/), a bold transdisciplinary art project that [bridges the gap between artistic expression and climate science](https://oceandecade.org/news/we-are-ocean-turning-the-tide-with-art-science-and-youth-empowerment/), with a focus on amplifying youth voices and empowering the next generation of ocean advocates. WE ARE OCEAN addresses Challenge 10: restore humanity's relationship with the ocean through art, cultural events and educational campaigns across the globe. 

10. [Seabed 2030 announces millions of square kilometers of new seafloor data on world hydrography day](https://oceandecade.org/news/seabed-2030-announces-new-seafloor-data-on-world-hydrography-day/): 27.3% of the world's ocean floor has now been mapped to modern standards. The theme of this year, 'Seabed mapping: enabling ocean action', highlights how bathymetric data underpins the blue economy, supporting sustainable marine energy, coastal tourism and fisheries, and contributes to global efforts to protect biodiversity and tackle climate change. From improving tsunami early-warning systems to guiding the installation of undersea cables and identifying biodiversity hotspots, seafloor data enables informed, real-world action.

11. Four marine protected areas were [honoured](https://oceandecade.org/news/2025-blue-park-award-winners-announced-at-the-un-ocean-conference/) with prestigious [Blue Park Awards](https://marine-conservation.org/blueparks/), an award for exceptional efforts in conserving marine biodiversity, were announced at the UN Ocean conference: [Cahuita National Park](https://marine-conservation.org/blueparks/awardees/cahuita/) in Costa Rica, [Gorgona National Natural Park](https://marine-conservation.org/blueparks/awardees/gorgona/) in Colombia, [Kaho-olawe Island Reserve](https://marine-conservation.org/blueparks/awardees/kahoolawe/) in Hawai'i and [Shark Fin Bay](https://marine-conservation.org/blueparks/awardees/shark-fin-bay/) in the Philippines. 

12. The Belmont Forum has officially [launched its new Collaborative Research Action (CRA) entitled “Ocean 2: Towards the Ocean We Want: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sustainability for Nature and Human Well-being”](https://oceandecade.org/news/cra-ocean-2-launch-towards-a-sustainable-ocean-for-nature-and-human-well-being/), a global initiative focused on creating a healthy, sustainable ocean for both nature and people. This CRA will drive transdisciplinary projects to help tackle urgent ocean challenges, ranging from biodiversity loss to climate change, aligning with global goals such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Ocean Decade Challenges. This call is a formal contribution to the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, and funded projects will be considered as formally endorsed Decade Actions. The key thematic areas are biodiversity conservation and nature-based solutions; ocean-biodiversity-climate integration; and nature futures, ocean governance, and ethics for sustainability. This initiative seeks truly transdisciplinary teams, bringing together experts from the natural and social sciences with societal partners (communities, industry, and NGOs) from at least three different countries, and is funded by at least three participating organizations. The length of the projects is expected to be 36 months. Proposals must be submitted as a “Research Consortium” and include a strong linkage between societal and environmental aspects within Global Change. All projects must also contribute to Ocean Decade Challenge 10, which focuses on empowering society to achieve the Decade’s objectives.

13. At the 3rd UN Ocean Conference, [Ocean Matcher](http://www.oceanmatcher.com/) was [officially launched](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-matcher-a-groundbreaking-tool-for-smarter-ocean-philanthropy-launches-at-the-un-ocean-conference-in-nice/). This pioneering tool is a response to one of the most pressing challenges of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (‘UN Ocean Decade’): ensuring that the right projects are matched with the right funders to accelerate innovation and impact. This innovative tool is directly aligned with the core ambitions of the UN Ocean Conference and the UN Ocean Decade. It reflects the growing global momentum toward practical solutions, technological innovation, and strategic philanthropy that can drive real change for the ocean.

14. At the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference, in Nice, Prada Group and UNESCO announced today [the launch of the SEA BEYOND – Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Connecting People and Ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/prada-group-and-unesco-launch-a-fund-for-ocean-preservation/). Starting with a contribution of €2 million by PRADA, the SEA BEYOND Multi-Partner Trust Fund will mobilize financial resources from a variety of partners to restore the relationship between humankind and the ocean – in line with one of the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, coordinated by UNESCO. The Fund will be the first of its kind to support projects that integrate ocean science, culture, and education in a synergistic and coherent manner, backing initiatives in five priority areas: Blue educations; youth empowerment and engagement; ocean culture and heritage; science-policy-society interface; and strategic communications and narrative shifting. 

15. UN and partners join forces to [advance a transformative financial architecture for the ocean](https://oceandecade.org/news/un-and-partners-join-forces-to-advance-a-transformative-financial-architecture-for-the-ocean/). By channeling these underutilized capital flows through an agile, scalable, and fit-for-purpose global platform, One Ocean Finance seeks to deliver triple-win outcomes: accelerating industry transition, restoring ocean health, and supporting resilient coastal communities. At its core, the Call for Engagement invites all sectors—governments, industry, finance, and civil society—to come together in shaping a more coherent and inclusive ocean finance architecture, one that reflects the true value of the ocean as a global asset.

16. Ocean science in action: [How capacity development helps to build inclusive and impactful ocean science](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-how-capacity-development-helps-to-build-inclusive-and-impactful-ocean-science/). Unlocking ocean potential – from climate change to sustainable food production and resilient economic growth – requires knowledge, people, and institutions with the skills and ability to generate sustainable solutions. Throughout the Pacific, ocean-faring and ocean-dependent local communities hold deep, generational knowledge of the ocean. In the Solomon Islands, the Babanakira people use an Indigenous early warning system based on natural signs like plant cycles or seasonal shifts to predict storms and apply traditional land management to reduce disaster risks. On the Torres Islands, crop diversity and land-use knowledge help communities adapt to seismic events. In Hawaiʻi, Native Hawaiians are restoring loko iʻa – 600-year-old fishponds that produce thousands of pounds of protein without damaging fish populations or threatening the wider ecosystem. By combining the systematic mapping of traditional knowledge with practical, community-driven guidance – and by emphasizing community ownership through formal project handover – the project advances a more inclusive and sustainable model of ocean governance.

17. The [EU Mission Ocean and Waters](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/restore-our-ocean-and-waters_en) celebrates an important milestone: since its launch in 2022, the [Mission Ocean Charter has reached an impressive number of over 1000 actions for the ocean](https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/mission-ocean-and-waters-over-1000-initiatives-protect-and-restore-marine-and-freshwater-ecosystems-2025-06-02_en). In total, these actions coming from individuals and organisations have mobilised more than €8 billion. This result marks a growing commitment across Europe to safeguard marine and freshwater ecosystems.

18. HUB Ocean and Mercuria launch '[Citizen Sea](https://www.hubocean.earth/citizen-sea)', a [new citizen science app](https://www.hubocean.earth/press/news/hubocean/and/mercuria/launch/citizensea) designed for everyone, to help close critical ocean data gaps. The app will enable users to photograph, upload and log sightings of marine wildlife or marine pollution directly from their phones. 

19. [Gabon and Global Fishing Watch signed a new pact to vow to ramp up the fight against illegal fishing](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/in-new-pact-gabon-and-global-fishing-watch-vow-to-ramp-up-fight-against-illegal-fishing/).  The new partnership will bolster the Central African nation's efforts to strengthen vessel tracking and promote data-driven ocean governance through transparency at sea. 

20. [Panama and Global Fishing Watch forged a landmark partnership to boost ocean protection](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/at-u-n-ocean-conference-panama-and-global-fishing-watch-forge-landmark-partnership-to-boost-ocean-protection/). This agreement will harness technology and transparency to strengthen surveillance of marine protected areas and safeguard biodiversity. 

21. [Two new working groups will join the Gulf Ecosystem Initiative](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/announcing-2025-gulf-ecosystem-initiative-working-groups). Their work explores timely and interdisciplinary questions in the Gulf of America—ranging from the ecological role of marine artificial structures to the integration of artificial intelligence into fisheries science. One of the working groups will synthesize existing data to better understand how reef fish interact with marine artificial structures. The second group will examine how emerging artificial intelligence technologies can be applied to fishery management and ecological forecasting in the Gulf of America.

22. The second Dialogues with Industries series, organised by the Marine Technology Society, GOOS, NOAA and the Integrated Ocean Observing System [focused on harmful algal blooms](https://goosocean.org/news/dialogues-with-industry-harmful-algal-blooms-summary-report-published/), exploring the market dynamics and identifying barriers and opportunities. The [Summary Report](https://mtsociety.memberclicks.net/assets/Dialogues%20with%20Industry%20HABs%20-%20Summary%20Report.pdf) is now available, providing a synthesis of insights from across all three Dialogues on harmful algal blooms and mapping twenty-one action pathways. Harmful algal blooms emerged as a priority due to their increasing frequency, economic impacts, and the growing demand for tech-enabled solutions that improve detection, monitoring, forecasting, and response. 

23. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have proven highly effective in conserving, and in some cases restoring, marine biodiversity. The [State of the Ocean Report 2024](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390054.locale=en), using OBIS data, highlighted that over half of all marine species, and 72% of threatened species, have been reported in Marine Protected Areas. With just over 18,000 MPAs worldwide, and most protection concentrated in the 100 largest sites, vast swaths of the Ocean remain unprotected and vulnerable. From a scientific point of view, [supporting the implementation of future MPAs is a complex challenge](https://www.obis.org/2025/08/01/mpa-day/). It involves mobilizing comprehensive data and analysis to produce actionable, reliable foresight so decision-makers can plan effectively for the future of Ocean health.

24. [The world's largest Marine Protected Area has been established in French Polynesia](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/worlds-largest-marine-protected-area-french-polynesia), which encompasses almost all French Polynesian waters and covers 4.5 million square kilometers. This is hugely significant because it means the region’s unique biodiversity is protected from a range of destructive practices like deep-sea mining and bottom trawling. Given that French Polynesia’s waters are extremely biodiverse – home to 21 shark species, 176 coral species and over 1,000 fish species – this enormous protected area will also help boost wildlife abundance in surrounding waters, as species spread out beyond the protected area over time. While the plans have been heralded by the international conservation community, the initiative is underpinned by strong local support and ownership. Indeed, a recent survey of 1,378 French Polynesians found that 92 per cent favour the creation of new marine protected areas because they view them as a way to honour cultural values and revive traditional management practices. This profound level of community support is well understood to be essential for long-term success.

25. An [international study](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-sustainability/fulltext/S2949-7906(25)00131-4) estimates that [scuba diving contributes between $8.5 and $20.4 billion to the global economy each year](https://oceandecade.org/news/new-study-scuba-diving-generates-up-to-20-billion-globally-per-year/), supporting up to 124,000 jobs across 170 countries, offering an economic incentive for marine conservation. While ocean-based tourism is recognized as an economic force, the specific contribution of scuba diving at the global scale remained unknown until now. This absence of economic data made it challenging for ocean advocates to concretely cite scuba’s economic benefits to argue for conservation policies. To find answers, the researchers compiled a list of more than 11,500 dive operators across 170 countries using data from Google Maps and PADI (the Professional Association of Diving Instructors), validating their database with local experts. They then conducted an online survey that netted responses from 425 businesses across 81 countries. The analysis revealed that direct spending on diving activities generates between $900 million and $3.2 billion annually, and between $8.5 and $20.4 billion when including indirect spending on accommodations and local services. The study also delivered key findings about the scuba businesses and their workforce: 80 percent of employees are local or national residents. The survey also revealed dive operators’ deep concern about environmental degradation, with most reporting negative changes at their dive sites over the past decade.

26. [14 new projects have been launched by the Copernicus Marine Service to advance coastal monitoring and marine capacity](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-projects-launched-advance-coastal-monitoring-activities-and-capacity-development-under). The selected projects span 11 European countries and will support the implementation of the EU Directives through model use cases, particularly between the open ocean and coastal zones. The projects are designed to improve coastal monitoring and forecasting services, foster the adoption of Copernicus Marine data, contribute to the implementation of EU directives, and reinforce both national and transnational capacity building in marine and coastal sectors.

**Restoration**
1. The growth of urban areas can be disastrous for nature, the climate and people if not managed sustainably. Despite occupying less than 1 per cent of the Earth’s landmass, cities produce at least 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. They also create over half of the planet’s waste, including around 288 million tonnes of plastic waste. We must consider how we can [reimagine our cities to protect and restore nature, reduce pollution, and ensure the well-being of urban communities](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/sustainable-cities-for-the-future). The UN Environment Programme’s [Generation Restoration Cities](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/cities) project aims to build momentum for urban restoration efforts and has selected eleven ‘Role Model Cities’ from across the globe. 

2. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) have named the [first World Restoration Flagships for this year](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-recognizes-world-restoration-flagships-east-africa-mexico-and), tackling pollution, unsustainable exploitation, and invasive species in three continents. These initiatives are restoring almost five million hectares of marine ecosystems – an area about the size of Costa Rica, which, together with France, is hosting the 3rd UN Ocean Conference. World Restoration Flagships are chosen as the best examples of ongoing, large-scale and long-term ecosystem restoration by a group of ecosystem restoration experts from the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration’s network.

3. The delta of Ecuador’s Guayas River and nearby tributaries contain the largest expanse of mangroves in the country. This forested labyrinth of tidal channels and low-lying islands is a crucial ecosystem. It teems with wildlife, soaks up floodwater and banks vast amounts of planet-warming carbon. But the delta is also the site of the country’s largest metropolitan area, a collection of cities and towns home to 3 million people. Here, large areas of forest have made way for urban sprawl and hundreds of shrimp farms. Now [a project backed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) aims to demonstrate that mangrove ecosystems and urban development can go hand in hand](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/facing-climate-storm-one-town-turns-mangroves-protection). City teams have planted thousands of mangroves around the delta municipality of Samborondón, the first step in what some hope will be a bigger push to protect local settlements from increasingly extreme weather. 

**Pollution**
1. [UNESCO and Plastic Odyssey join forces to tackle plastic pollution in marine world heritage sites](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2779). Covering more than 2 million km²—an area comparable to the size of South Africa—marine ecosystems inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List are among the most ecologically significant on the planet. These sites harbour over 10% of all known marine species, safeguard one-third of marine species at risk of extinction, and store 15% of the world’s blue carbon in their seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves. Despite their vital ecological role, these exceptional environments are increasingly impacted by the global plastic pollution crisis. The cooperation agreement, signed on 10 June 2025, builds on the success of a pioneering mission carried out in 2024 on Henderson Island, a remote UNESCO World Heritage site in the South Pacific. Despite its isolation, the island is burdened by significant plastic accumulation. During the expedition, over 9 tonnes of plastic waste were recovered and transformed—an effort that demonstrated both the magnitude of the crisis and the feasibility of impactful solutions. The next operation will take place at Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles, another remote UNESCO World Heritage site facing increasing plastic accumulation. In October 2025, an expert team will carry out a preliminary mission to assess the situation on the ground—mapping plastic accumulation, testing removal methods, and developing scientific monitoring protocols. The results of this mission will inform a series of larger-scale cleanup efforts planned to begin in 2026.

2. A [new Canadian marine plastics recovery program traces its origins to the plight of albatrosses in the Midway Islands](https://oceandecade.org/news/plight-of-the-albatross-sparked-bc-plastics-recycling-program/), which were struggling with the ingestion of plastics. It all began around 2012–2013, when the idiom “an albatross around one’s neck” had an impact on a group of concerned environmentalists in British Columbia. That awareness led to a 2013 event in Alaska that collected about 40,000 pounds of plastic debris within four days. To date, the amount of plastics diverted from landfills through this program has reached 5,286,670 pounds. 

**Open calls**
1. [Call for new expert members of the Decade Advisory Board now open](https://oceandecade.org/news/shaping-the-future-of-the-ocean-decade-call-for-new-expert-members-of-the-decade-advisory-board-now-open/), which will drive the implementation of the second half of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030, guided by the outcomes of the [Vision 2030](https://oceandecade.org/vision-2030/) process and the Mid-Term Evaluation, and support preparations for the [2027 Ocean Decade Conference](https://oceandecade.org/news/rio-de-janeiro-to-host-2027-ocean-decade-conference/). The new expert members of the Decade Advisory Board will be selected through an open call for nominations, which is currently accepting submissions until 15 October 2025 at 23.59h CEST.

3. For a special issue in Ecosystem Services, named 'Making visible the invisible: addressing knowledge gaps and methodological challenges in valuation of underrepresented ecosystem services', they are [looking for a female colleague from Latin America to join a team of guest editors](https://www.es-partnership.org/collaboration-call-for-special-issue-in-ecoser/). The ideal candidate will have broad knowledge and high-quality research experience in ecosystem services, with a focus on valuation and cultural ecosystem services. 

**Platforms and initiatives**
1. The [Sustainable Development Goals Report 2025](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2025/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2025.pdf) has been [launched](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2025/). With the 2030 deadline only five years away, the report delivers a stark assessment: the Sustainable Development Goals have improved millions of lives, but the current pace of change is insufficient to fully achieve all the Goals by 2030.

2. GBIF and geographic information system (GIS) technology leader Esri have [launched a new partnership to facilitate the direct integration of GBIF-mediated biodiversity data with Esri's suite of mapping and analysis software](https://www.gbif.org/news/3XMOoOZ2DcZX4uKjqFxIk7/partnership-with-esri-gives-arcgis-community-easy-access-to-species-occurrence-records). This first-of-its-kind collaboration aims to improve overall data quality, accessibility and the delivery of open access biodiversity data to Esri’s global user base, empowering researchers, governments and decision-makers to more effectively incorporate biodiversity data into spatial analyses and planning. The new GBIF integration is expected to streamline workflows for governments, academic institutions, NGOs and businesses around the world who already use Esri products. It is anticipated that the barriers to using GBIF-mediated data will be significantly reduced for users in the GIS and spatial planning and environmental mapping communities.

3. Eyes in the Sky: [UNESCO launches the Sites Navigator to monitor heritage in near-real time](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2801). Originally launched in 2023 to support the monitoring of World Heritage properties, the UNESCO Sites Navigator has evolved into a powerful tool for integrated management and enhanced visibility of UNESCO-designated sites. By displaying the official boundaries of these sites—achieved through sustained intersectoral collaboration across the Culture and Natural Sciences sectors—the platform offers a unified view. The UNESCO Sites Navigator integrates nearly 40 relevant datasets to strengthen monitoring through remote sensing and to provide deeper insights into the sites’ values, geographical features, and exposure to risks and pressures. A standout feature is the automated alert system, which delivers daily and weekly updates on potential risks — such as wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, coral bleaching, or vegetation loss — based on near real-time satellite data. While these alerts do not confirm damage, they provide early situational awareness for site managers and decision-makers, enabling timely responses. The alert system currently focuses on World Heritage properties, with plans to expand to other UNESCO designations.

**News and updates about applications**
1. [Save The Waves is a worldwide coalition](https://oceandecade.org/news/from-waves-to-action-recognizing-coastal-threats-beyond-trash/) which looks to protect the waves and make beaches safe and healthy for everyone. The [Save The Waves App](https://oceandecade.org/actions/save-the-waves-mobile-app/) can be used to monitor coastline threats. Save The Waves aims to protect 1,000 surf ecosystems by 2030, and addresses three Ocean Decade Challenges: 1. understand and beat marine pollution, 2. protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity and 10. restore humanity's relationship with the ocean. With the Save The Waves App, it is possible to report any coastal threat ranging from plastic and trash, erosion, water quality, coastal development, sea level rise, coral reef impacts and others. When users see something wrong at their local surf spot, they can take a photo, choose the type of threat and tag their location. When these threats are reported, especially in areas like the World Surfing Reserves, it sends out an immediate alert, and then action is taken, sometimes with a follow up with the individual who reported the initial sighting, creating ocean stewards and citizen scientists.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [GBIF establishes a task group on Indigenous data governance](https://www.gbif.org/news/1Ke3Gk2USgdIW5OgDlBIKY/open-data-for-people-and-purpose-gbif-establishes-task-group-on-indigenous-data-governance). The GBIF Indigenous data governance task group is composed of a dozen experts, eight members and four alternates, who will lend their insights and experience to help the GBIF network establish community norms aimed at protecting Indigenous rights and interests in biodiversity data and knowledge. The group's initial efforts will focus on assessing and understanding GBIF nodes' familiarity about the CARE principles and overseeing a pilot testing the application of Traditional Knowledge and Biocultural Labels to open biodiversity data. 

2. In the dynamic landscape of Open Science, [maintaining the integrity and reliability of scholarly metadata is more important than ever](https://www.openaire.eu/the-mutable-truth-why-freezing-and-versioning-metadata-is-essential-for-open-science-research-assessment). As Open Science broadens access to research, from traditional journal articles to datasets and software, the need for robust metadata practices becomes clear. Among these, metadata freezing and versioning play a crucial role in supporting trustworthy and transparent research assessment. Often, the scientists themselves handle metadata entry: filling out attribution and citation fields, uploading files, and finalising the deposition. This process can lead to errors due to misinterpretation or lack of oversight, but a deeper problem lies in metadata mutability. Even when a DOI is assigned and the files are frozen, the metadata can still be edited. While this flexibility is generally advantageous, for example, for post-publication corrections, it can also be exploited for malicious purposes. Ideally, metadata files should adhere to common standards (such as codemeta and CFF), ensuring uniformity of representation across diverse repository platforms and allowing for the validation of repository metadata trustworthiness.

3. [Navigating naming convention incongruity in data science](https://oceanhealthindex.org/news/naming_conventions/). There are many different ways people may label and organize data, even those in the same lab or working group. To overcome this, there are some R-packages and functions. For example, variation in the spelling of country names is derived from a wide variety of factors. Most prominently, researchers tend to record labels and identifiers in their native languages, and compilations of data translated from one language to another will differ based on the type of translation. To address these inconsistencies, people often choose a single standard of naming conventions and convert any mismatches. Instead of manually renaming countries, the [countrycode package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/countrycode/versions/1.6.1/topics/countrycode) can be used, which converts country names into UN naming conventions in several different languages as well as dialects. There is also a package that can be used to standardise taxonomic and common names of marine species: [rfishbase](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rfishbase/versions/5.0.1).

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [AI and climate action: opportunities, risks and challenges for developing countries](https://unfccc.int/news/ai-and-climate-action-opportunities-risks-and-challenges-for-developing-countries). A [new technical paper](https://unfccc.int/ttclear/misc_/StaticFiles/gnwoerk_static/AI4climateaction/f2922b97c4cf431996c468e622127eb5/112f8be560ea447dab5ff2e53ab3f6e4.pdf) released by the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) under the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can serve as a powerful enabler of climate action in developing countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. AI technologies offer significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, AI can help minimize energy waste, optimize energy consumption and distribution, and identify emission hotspots in industrial processes. AI-powered energy management systems can improve grid efficiency, forecast power demand, and optimize the deployment of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Similarly, AI tools can analyze transportation data to optimize traffic flow and route planning, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Additionally, AI also offers promising applications when it comes to adapting to the impacts of climate change. It can strengthen early warning systems by predicting extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and droughts, enabling proactive disaster risk management. AI-driven urban resilience planning can help identify infrastructure vulnerabilities and optimize land use. When combined with satellite imagery, AI can also support biodiversity conservation, sustainable water use, and land restoration efforts. Despite these benefits, the paper highlights that bias and inequity in AI systems also present serious risks. If algorithms are not designed inclusively, they can perpetuate social inequalities and undermine trust. Additionally, the energy and water consumption of AI systems raises sustainability concerns, particularly in regions already facing resource constraints. The paper also warns that many developing countries face significant barriers to adopting AI-driven climate solutions. Limited digital infrastructure – including unreliable internet connectivity, inadequate computing power, and capacity shortages – hinder the effective deployment of AI systems.

2. [Today’s wildfires have spun far beyond nature’s balance, driven by climate variability, land-use change, and growing human pressure](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/wildfire-without-borders-why-we-need-smarter-early-warning-and-risk-response). They are no longer just forest events – they have become crises that ripple through health systems, economies and the global climate. In July 2025, in just one week, nearly 3,000 fires burned more than 4.6 million hectares across western Canada. The smoke didn’t stop at the border. Cities in the US Midwest saw air pollution spike to hazardous levels (Air Quality Index (AQI) over 150 for several hours), as tracked by satellites like MODIS, GOES-R and VIIRS. These fires show why wildfires are no longer local problems. Smoke travels hundreds of miles, carrying fine particulates that can cause severe harm to lungs and hearts, particularly in children and older adults. While the World Health Organization recommends safe daily levels below 15 µg/m³, wildfire smoke can push it past 100 µg/m³, levels known to increase hospitalisations and even deaths. The real opportunity? Fusing systems like GOES-R’s geostationary coverage, VIIRS’s fine resolution, and TEMPO’s air composition data into an integrated, real-time early warning network. But technology alone won’t save us. We need systems that connect early detection with public health alerts, emergency response and community resilience; across borders. This includes more innovative land management practices (such as timed and staggered prescribed burns), faster data sharing and enhanced local preparedness.

**Biodiversity**
1. Collaboration, capacity-building and conservation in East Africa: [rangers trained on monitoring the illegal killing of elephants](), a collaboration by CITES and the College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka, in the United Republic of Tanzania. This training of trainers was designed to equip rangers with the expertise to apply their knowledge in the field while also enabling them to train and mentor other rangers in their respective conservation areas. Its primary purpose was to strengthen the skills and knowledge of rangers in combating wildlife crime, with a specific emphasis on elephant mortality data collection and reporting as well as introducing them to wildlife crime scene management techniques, including the type and cause of death, detection method, age and sex of the elephant before death and the presence or absence of tusks. Participants also engaged in practical exercises to ensure they could collect this information systematically using standardised protocols and apply crime scene management techniques to preserve evidence for court proceedings.

2. IUCN launches [11 new SOS Lemur Phase II projects](https://iucnsos.org/iucn-launches-11-new-sos-lemurs-phase-ii-projects-in-madagascar/) in Madagascar, aimed at safeguarding threatened lemur species, enhancing habitat restoration, engaging with local communities and advancing scientific research to further the understanding of these unique primates. The launch event underscored the importance of collaborative efforts in conservation, bringing together stakeholders from a wide range of sectors. SOS Lemurs Phase II is more than just a conservation initiative; it aims to foster long-term, sustainable solutions for both lemurs and the people living alongside them. By integrating socio-economic development with conservation efforts, the initiative is designed to provide local communities with sustainable livelihoods, ensuring that the conservation of lemurs also benefits the human populations who share their environment. As Madagascar faces mounting challenges like deforestation, climate change, and habitat fragmentation, the work of initiatives such as SOS Lemurs remains vital in securing a future for these remarkable primates.

3. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have major goals to restore their degraded landscapes. Forest loss has been a decades-long problem, with the region losing nearly 15 million hectares of trees (1.2% of the total) from 2015 to 2023. However, recognizing the importance of forests for both people and nature, 18 countries have committed to protect and restore over 50 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030 as part of [Initiative 20x20](https://initiative20x20.org/). With five years left to achieve the goal, how are countries doing? For the first time, with new satellite data, it is possible to show where trees are growing, where they remain standing, and where they're disappearing. The [data shows that while Latin America overall lost more tree cover than it gained from 2015 to 2023, progress is being made compared to historical trends](https://www.wri.org/insights/tree-cover-declining-latin-america-new-data-shows-where-increasing). Among the 18 countries participating in Initiative 20x20, three countries gained tree cover from 2015 to 2023, 10 remained neutral and five experienced losses. Using this data, national and local governments can better identify successful programs or where change is needed.

4. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) [launched](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-UK-aim4nature-to-ecosystem-restoration/en) Accelerating Innovative Monitoring for Nature Restoration ([AIM4NatuRe](https://www.fao.org/ecosystem-restoration-monitoring/aim4natuRe/en)), a new initiative with GBP 7 million from the United Kingdom to improve monitoring and reporting of global ecosystem restoration efforts. Countries will receive support to build capacity and use the latest technology to monitor and report their progress towards target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), which aims to restore at least 30 percent of degraded ecosystems by 2030. To ensure seamless data sharing and analysis, AIM4NatuRe will prioritize data interoperability. This will involve establishing standardized data formats and protocols that facilitate the harmonization and aggregation of data collected at national levels into a global reporting framework. This will enhance transparency and comparability while reducing the reporting burden for countries. AIM4NatuRe will also develop practical guidance documents and technical solutions, namely the Framework for Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring (FERM), to support countries in data collection, analysis, and reporting, ensuring that information is readily available and usable. Notably, the initiative will support Indigenous Peoples in the monitoring of biocentric nature restoration, a holistic approach that prioritizes the well-being of all living things within an ecosystem. A pilot with FAO's Indigenous Peoples unit will take place in Brazil and Peru.

5. Efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing have received a boost from the People's Republic of China, the world’s largest capture fisheries producer, which has become the [108th State to join the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA)](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/boostfor-the-global-fight-against-illegalunreported-and-unregulated-fishing/en). The PSMA supports sustainable fisheries by ensuring that only legal, regulated and reported fish catches are landed in ports and eventually traded. It does this by enabling Parties to deny port entry or use of port to foreign vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing, thereby preventing catches from such illicit practices from reaching markets and consumers. They reveal for example that more than 40 percent of all taxa surveyed are no longer present in at least one of the areas where they were previously cultivated or occurred naturally, while about one-third of tree species are threatened. 

6. Genetic diversity is key to creating more resilient agrifood systems that withstand challenges such as shifting climate patterns. Since 80 percent of the food we consume is plant-based, preserving a wide range of genetic materials allows farmers to grow crops and varieties suited to their local environments, enhancing food security and livelihoods. As the world faces widespread hunger, malnutrition and poverty, exacerbated by biodiversity loss, climate change, land degradation, and conflicts, there is an urgent need to halt the loss of the genetic resources that support agrifood systems. Two [new reports](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/the-genetic-diversity-of-our-plants-and-forests-is-at-risk--new-fao-reports-warn/en) emphasise the need for urgent action: the [Third report on the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd4711en) and the [Second report on the state of the world's forest genetic resources](https://doi.org/10.4060/cd4838en). Supporting genetic diversity in agriculture goes beyond protecting species and varieties. It also preserves traditional practices and cultures worldwide, including those of Indigenous Peoples, small-scale agricultural producers, and local communities. These people are the stewards of much of the world’s genetic resources and biodiversity.

7. The Data Science Network for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Biodiversity, [Redbioma](https://redbioma.org/en), has [launched](https://www.gbif.org/news/6PmnmBl0TSa0uQeXoCgrnb/redbioma-portal-to-boost-collaboration-and-capacity-in-mesoamerica) a [GBIF hosted portal](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) to advance regional efforts to foster cross-border collaboration, promote free and open access to biodiversity data and strengthen capacity in data-driven biodiversity science across Central America and Mexico. The Redbioma portal currently helps users explore more than 94 million occurrence records across 1,100-plus datasets from nearly 200 institutions. The site also enables search and discovery of regional events and training courses as well as GBIF-enabled scientific and policy publications authored or co-written by researchers based in Mesoamerican institutions. By reducing data fragmentation and promoting open science in the region, the Redbioma portal aims to enhance regional collaboration, improve access to biodiversity information and reflect Mesoamerica’s growing leadership in open data and biodiversity informatics.

**Climate**
1. The [Sports for Climate Action training courses has been launched](https://unfccc.int/news/new-training-course-aims-at-boosting-sustainability-of-sports), a step forward in the broader capacity-building programme under the UN Climate Change Sports for Climate Action Initiative. [Introduction to sports for climate action](https://unccelearn.org/course/view.php?id=214&page=overview) was designed for anyone interested in how sports and climate change intersect, and what can be done to build a more sustainable, resilient sports sector. [Sports for climate action](https://unccelearn.org/course/view.php?id=215&page=overview) was designed to support sports organisations, from local clubs to international governing bodies, in adopting and implementing sustainable practices that reduce their environmental impact. The courses were developed with the support of sportswear giant Adidas as part of its ‘Move for the Planet’ initiative, which aims to harness the power of sporting communities to promote sustainability and climate action. Through the UN Climate Change Sports for Climate Action Initiative, sports organizations can become catalysts for environmental responsibility, community engagement and global collaboration. A dedicated training series for grassroots sports NGOs is on the way, aimed at empowering local communities with the knowledge and tools they need to co-design climate solutions that reflect their realities and priorities. This upcoming initiative will further extend the reach of the Sports for Climate Action Initiative, ensuring that climate action through sport is inclusive, community-led and impactful.

2. The Santiago Network and the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage signed a [letter of intent](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frld_climateaction-santiagonetwork-frld-activity-7293689863692836864-Xk5h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAACMPo7kBsddxVv4u-57iTYuQeynXVdMDC1Y) on how to [provide support to vulnerable populations and communities facing climate-related losses](https://unfccc.int/news/a-vital-partnership-to-strengthen-support-for-vulnerable-communities). The letter signals a commitment to operationalise guidance from COP28 to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and intense storms, droughts and wildfires.

**Oceans**
1. As one of the world’s megadiverse countries, Brazil has a crucial role in biodiversity data collection in all realms. After a short interruption due to internal reorganization, the OBIS Brazil Node is [back in operation](https://www.obis.org/2025/04/23/brazil-rejoins-obis/). Hosted by the SiBBr, the Brazilian Biodiversity Information System, the renewed OBIS Node aims to improve marine biodiversity data coverage in the region, focusing, among other things, on gap-filling and the possibility of integrating local and Indigenous knowledge into available datasets. Eventually, beyond improving scientific knowledge, Brazil’s ambitions are to reinforce its role and strengthen its position as a substantial biodiversity data contributor on the global stage. 

2. [The offshore oil boom is fueling a climate crisis at sea](https://globalfishingwatch.org/news-story/the-offshore-oil-boom-is-fueling-a-climate-crisis-at-sea/), has been revealed in a new report, [Exposing the environmental costs of offshore oil: greenhouse gas emissions, oil slicks, and flaring](https://skytruth.org/section/environmental-costs-offshore-oil/) from environmental watchdog SkyTruth. The report offers the most comprehensive dataset to date on offshore oil infrastructure and its findings come at a time when nearly three-quarters of new oil production is taking place offshore, often beyond the reach of effective regulation. Drawing on more than a year's worth of satellite imagery, the analysis exposes extensive and recurring oil spills, methane flaring and greenhouse gas emissions from both conventional platforms and increasingly common floating production and storage vessels, raising the alarm about the growing environmental toll of the offshore oil and gas industry and its long-term impacts on the climate. The report also spotlights the uneven impact of pollution on the marine ecosystems and communities of low- and middle-income coastal countries. West Africa, a region where the most polluting offshore oil and gas infrastructure is concentrated, is prominently featured in the report with five of the top ten most polluting sites detected in Nigeria. Other countries featured among those most impacted by offshore pollution include Angola, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Norway. 

3. [Keeping connected: submarine communications cables and ocean life](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/keeping-connected-submarine-communications-cables-and-ocean-life). They carry almost all of the world’s intercontinental internet traffic and play a fundamental role in the global economy as well as enabling everyday activities such as emails, video calls, live streaming and personal messaging services. The global submarine cable network spans over 1.7 million kilometres, crossing national boundaries and continents, from the shallow seas to the deep ocean with demand for its capacity continuing to grow. Given the rapid expansion of the submarine cable network, it is crucial to consider its impact on marine biodiversity.  To address this, UNEP-WCMC worked with the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) to assess the potential impacts of installing, operating and removing submarine cables, while exploring strategies to mitigate any negative impacts in the future. The findings are now available in a new report, '[Submarine cables and marine biodiversity]https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT691)'. Overall, the analysis found that submarine cables have a relatively small footprint in the marine environment. Globally, less than 0.01 per cent of the seafloor is within 10 metres of submarine cables. Potential pressures and resultant impacts from cable activities on marine biodiversity are generally local and minimal, although they do vary spatially and over the cable lifecycle. A key finding of the new report is that sensing technology, used within the submarine cable industry, presents potential benefits and opportunities as follows: Submarine cables can detect extreme weather events, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and allow for more precise monitoring of underwater eruptions and earthquakes; and fibre-optic sensing can detect the mating and feeding calls of blue, fin and baleen whales.

4. [MINKA](https://minka-sdg.org/), a [citizen science observatory](https://oceandecade.org/actions/minka-citizen-science-observatory/) created by marine scientists and conservationists from Spain, has been endorsed as Ocean Decade Action as a project within the Marine Life 2030 programme for its [significant contribution to global ocean sustainability](https://oceandecade.org/news/minka-a-species-observation-platform-documenting-biodiversity-one-photo-at-a-time/). What makes MINKA stand out is its inclusive approach to ecosystem restoration and protection. The team, which includes many women working in fields such as marine litter, taxonomy, data governance, science-based policy and resource management, is dedicated to making science accessible for all. While initially focused on marine species and EOVs, MINKA is now used to document flora and fauna, water temperature and even litter from any ecosystem. By sharing educational content, citizen science opportunities and stunning images of marine species, MINKA is inspiring individuals around the world to document species diversity in their neighborhoods.

5. A team of scientists has created a new [guide 'Introduction to developing DNA reference barcode sequences'](https://zenodo.org/records/14867763), developed by the West Coast Biomolecular Observing Network, to advance standards for collecting and cataloging DNA from marine species, enhancing a revolutionary method for monitoring ocean biodiversity. While research standards are already established across scientific fields, this guide offers diverse insights focusing on DNA barcode sequencing for marine species, compiling best practices into a single resource. DNA barcodes sequences are short, unique identifiers for each species. By standardizing methods, the guide aims to ensure the accuracy and consistency of DNA submitted to global databases like GenBank or the Barcode of Life Data System.

6. [Scuba diving with transformar transforms young people into ocean advocates](https://oceandecade.org/news/scuba-diving-with-transformar-transforms-young-people-into-ocean-advocates/). Scuba diving is expensive, making it hard to access for individuals in lower-income communities. To break this barrier, [TransforMAR](https://www.transformar.eco.br/) was founded, providing young people from low-income families with the opportunity to dive without completing a full certification course. It is more affordable, and each dive is guided by a certified instructor, ensuring both safety and accessibility for people of all abilities, and combines the dive with theoretical and practical educational activities focused on marine biology and environmental conservation, promoting environmental awareness among vulnerable youth. As youth participate in TransforMAR activities, they are encouraged to share the knowledge they gained in those experiences with their communities through their Ocean Ambassadors programme which supports incoming students as they create and carry out impactful projects. This approach amplifies youth voices as leaders in their communities and supports new youth leaders in a sustainable way to help shape a new generation of ocean advocates. 

7. Ocean science in action: what is sustainable ocean planning and why must it be rooted in science? As the demand for ocean space grows, so do the pressures and trade-offs between conservation, livelihoods, and development. The closure of some islands for coral restoration can create tensions with local tourism businesses. Plans to expand Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can clash with energy or shipping interests. When existing uses are affected by new plans or policies, concerns can emerge. [How do we turn potential conflicts into win-win solutions where both people and the ocean can thrive?](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-what-is-sustainable-ocean-planning-and-why-must-it-be-rooted-in-science/) These are the challenges and opportunities of managing the ocean sustainably: balancing economic development with the need to protect marine ecosystems. Sustainable ocean planning helps nations map out how to use their ocean space wisely, with tools like MPAs, fishing regulations, and pollution management. Four success stories highlight how the Ocean Decade is turning scientific research into solutions for more sustainable ocean policies: the global gold standard for ocean protection [Blue Parks](https://oceandecade.org/actions/blue-parks/), [swimways](https://oceandecade.org/actions/migravias-connecting-marine-protected-areas-mpas-through-ocean-swimways-to-protect-migratory-routes-and-critical-habitats-of-endangered-species/), safe wildlife corridors across the Eastern Pacific that connect MPAs, [living ocean labs](https://oceandecade.org/actions/hybrid-governance-high-seas/) for high seas protection, and [Whales and Climate](https://oceandecade.org/actions/whales-and-climate/), an international research project on understanding how climate change is reshaping the lives of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales and what that means for the ocean.

8. The onshore component of the Argentine red shrimp fishery has become the country's [first coastal shrimp fishery to achieve MSC certification](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2025/04/03/argentine-red-shrimp-fishery-achieves-msc-certification-after-decade-of-sustainability-efforts), marking a major milestone for sustainability in the region. The milestone recognises significant advancements in fishery management, environmental monitoring, and the reduction of ecological impacts. By meeting MSC’s rigorous criteria, the fishery will contribute to both the long-term abundance of the shrimp population and the protection of the surrounding marine ecosystem. Argentine red shrimp, known for its high quality and vibrant colour, has been one of the fastest-growing seafood products globally over the past 15 years. With an annual catch of approximately 72,000 metric tons, the fishery plays a crucial role in Argentina’s economy, supporting jobs in coastal communities and strengthening local industry. As global demand for certified sustainable seafood rises, Argentina’s red shrimp fishery is positioning itself as a leader in responsible fishing, benefiting both the environment and the economy.

9. The health of the climate is inseparable from the health of the Ocean. As temperatures rise, the ocean absorbs much of the excess heat. Ocean warming has major consequences, from increased stratification in the ocean, change in ocean currents and sea level rise to reduced solubility of carbon and damage to the Earth’s cryosphere. These shifts are already impacting coastal communities, fisheries, and natural habitats. Understanding this complex, dynamic system is key to predicting and preparing for what comes next. Through [investment in blue science and international collaboration](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/safeguarding-our-ocean-and-climate-through-european-innovation), the European Union is putting the Ocean at the core of its climate strategy – showcased at the [EU Digital Ocean Pavilion](https://www.digitaloceanpavilion.eu/) at UNOC3 from 2 – 13 June 2025.

10. Global sea levels have risen by 15-25 cm from 1901 to 2018, with the global rate nearly doubling in the last two decades. This rise is fuelled by melting glaciers and ice sheets, thermal expansion (as ocean water warms), and changes in terrestrial water storage. While the pace may seem gradual, the long-term impacts are becoming increasingly clear: infrastructure damages, erosions, increased coastal flooding and habitat loss. With many EU Member States hosting extensive and densely populated coastlines, [sea level rise is an urgent concern](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/rising-tides-how-europe-responding-sea-level-rise). From the low-lying Netherlands to the Mediterranean regions of Italy and Greece, the risks include coastal flooding and erosion, damage to transport, infrastructure and housing, disruption to tourism, fisheries and trade, threats to biodiversity and food security. The expected annual damage caused by coastal floods for Europe alone stands at €1.25 billion euros, with the potential to increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude if coastal adaptation measures remain at their current level. Although there is no single EU policy targeting sea level rise, several frameworks support resilience and adaptation: the EU Climate Adaptation Strategy, the EU Floods Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and the EU Ocean Pact. These policies help assess and manage risk, enhance regional preparedness, and encourage integrated planning across sectors. The European Green Deal further reinforces this work by aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, while promoting economic growth that is decoupled from resource use — tackling both causes and consequences of sea level rise.

**Pollution**
1. [Marine ecosystems are under growing pressure from pollution](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/europes-approach-mitigating-marine-pollution) – from plastics and chemicals to oil spills. These pollutants are transforming vital marine and coastal habitats into toxic zones. The impact extends beyond ecosystems: oceans regulate Earth’s climate by storing carbon and distributing heat. Oceans are absorbing the byproducts of modern life at an unsustainable rate. The European Union blends policy with technology to tackle marine pollution. From 2 to 13 June 2025, the EU Digital Ocean Pavilion at the Third United Nations Ocean Conference will showcase these efforts. On 10 June 2025, the [European Digital Ocean Pavilion](https://www.digitaloceanpavilion.eu/) at the Third United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC3) will host a morning session on marine pollution. Topics will include nutrients, plastics, heavy metals, and underwater noise – and the innovative ways Europe is addressing them.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [Predicting cholera using remote sensing data: a glimpse into the future](). Cholera remains a significant public health concern globally, with an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths annually (WHO). Remote sensing data is revolutionising the prediction of cholera outbreaks, with a number of strong examples in Africa. For instance, remote sensing data can track changes in sea surface temperature, precipitation and water quality, all of which are critical factors in cholera dynamics. One notable example is the use of satellite data to predict cholera outbreaks in coastal regions of Africa. Researchers have utilised data on sea surface temperature, air temperatures, precipitation and chlorophyll concentrations to forecast cholera outbreaks with significant accuracy.

2. Europe is taking control of its digital future. With the [launch of LLMs4Europe](https://www.openaire.eu/llms4europe-launches-europe-builds-its-own-fine-tuned-large-language-models-for-key-sectors), over 70 partners from across the continent have joined forces to build open, trustworthy, and multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to European needs. Crucially, the pilot connects to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), leveraging Europe’s open science infrastructure to access, process, and validate scientific knowledge. OpenAIRE leads efforts to mobilise trusted, multilingual content from repositories, publishers, and scholarly societies, effectively building a Data Space connector to power the fine-tuned LLM models with FAIR and verified data. It will also co-develop applications to test the factual reliability of outputs, ensuring that AI tools for science remain transparent and accountable. In addition, OpenAIRE hopes to learn from the data space architecture and governance models developed in the project, and to create synergies with AI technology providers, paving the way for new applications that combine open science and cutting-edge AI.

### Issue 3
Date: 29 March 2025

### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The second resumed session of the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP16) took place from the 25th to the 27th of February 2025 in Rome, Italy, which a focus on a series of key decisions where consensus had not been reached, related to biodiversity finance; planning, monitoring, reporting and review; and to the monitoring framework to measure progress towards the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Monitoring Framework. The following [key decisions were adopted](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/key-decisions-agreed-as-cbd-cop16-concludes-in-rome): 1. Mobilizing resources from all sources – public and private, domestic and international – to close the biodiversity finance gap, and 2. Resolving a long-unresolved issue regarding the financial mechanism of the Convention, which is aimed at operationalizing international financial flows from developed to developing countries in order to fulfil commitments under Article 20 of the Convention. 

2. This year's theme for World Wildlife Day was [Wildlife conservation finance: investing in people and planet](https://cites.org/eng/news/collaborative-partnership-on-sustainable-wildlife-management-join-statement-world-wildlife-day-2025). While public finance, overseas development assistance, and philanthropy remain fundamental funding sources, expanding traditional financing through innovative mechanisms such as payments for ecosystem services, debt-for nature swaps, biodiversity credits, sustainable biodiversity-based economic activities, green bonds, and benefit-sharing schemes is critical. Furthermore, private finance for nature has grown significantly, increasing elevenfold in just four years—from $9.4 billion to over $102 billion, as highlighted at the 3rd World Biodiversity Forum in Davos. Yet, despite this progress, a $700 billion annual funding gap persists for nature conservation. Additionally, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities continue to receive limited direct financial support.

2. In October 2024, the Protected Planet Report 2024 was launched by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN. As of March 2025, 17.54% of land and inland water areas are protected or conserved, as well as 8.45% of marine areas. A widely used approach to recognizing important spaces for nature globally is the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) standard. There are over 16,500 areas mapped within the World Database of KBAs, covering more than 22 million km2, or 4.3 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Important areas are also identified through other processes at national, regional and global scales. Prioritizing protection of KBAs and other important spaces for biodiversity can focus available resources on priority areas, including for threatened and vulnerable species and habitats. Yet the Protected Planet Report revealed that while two-thirds of KBAs are protected or conserved to some extent, almost one-third lack any form of protection at all. Conservation efforts must therefore be scaled up to prioritize these spaces. The Protected Planet Report [highlights](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/beyond-coverage-strengthening-the-quality-of-protected-and-conserved-areas) that approximately one in four ecoregions have more than 30 per cent protection, and only 8.5% of land is both connected and protected. Many ecoregions still lack adequate protection, and greater focus is needed on achieving ecological representativeness, as outlined in Target 3. Most sites are reported under the governance of national governments, with limited recognition of non-state governance. Only 3.95 per cent of the total global coverage of protected and conserved areas is reported as being governed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, 0.5 per cent is under private governance and 11.84 per cent is under shared governance. However, the Protected Planet Report estimates that when combining Indigenous and traditional territories alongside protected and conserved areas, global coverage of land and inland water areas under protected, conserved or Indigenous and traditional management is at least 31.2 per cent. 

4. Women4Biodiversity [launches Restore HER Rights Initiative](https://women4biodiversity.org/restore-her-rights-global-virtual-launch/) in Argentina, Costa Rica, Cameroon, Kenya, Myanmar and the Solomon Islands. Women4Biodiversity has been advancing gender equality in restoration processes globally since 2021. To give this engagement a bigger push, Women4Biodiversity will launch the Restore HER Rights Initiative to foster a collaborative space for learning and advocacy in gender-responsive approaches to ecosystem restoration. The Restore HER Rights Initiative aims to document community-led restoration processes while amplifying women's vital contributions to ecosystem restoration. Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo5uO_HAErzCnG5PtrQVY6DgZP8agmdt7Suq7vZMq-0cAEdQ/viewform) to become a part of this initiative.

5. UNESCO is working with Cameroon's Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife to promote [community-based sustainable tourism and conservation activities](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2743) around UNESCO World Heritage sites in Cameroon. Cameroon has two natural sites on the World Heritage List, which contain some of the most important tropical rainforests in the Congo Basin. Since 2023, UNESCO has been providing micro-grants in these protected areas to strengthen local capacity and provide direct funding for locally designed projects that benefit both people and biodiversity. In 2023–2024, UNESCO awarded nine micro-grants totalling $40,000, which helped build the capacity of 160 people including local authorities and community members, the majority of whom were women. This initiative provided hands-on training and experiential learning in project and business management, arts and crafts, local production of medicinal soap, mapping tourism potential, and the transfer of knowledge from elders to the younger generations on the cultures, traditions and interaction of Indigenous Peoples and local communities with the environment, among others. This exchange is essential, as traditions, Indigenous and local knowledge play a key role in promoting practices that enhance environmental stewardship. Building on this success, a second phase of the micro-grants programme was launched in December 2024 with a workshop to train participants in project management, and a total of 12 new local initiatives were selected for funding. These projects will support snail farming as an alternative source of protein, sustainable wild yam and honey harvesting by the Indigenous Baka people, and the organisation of traditional dances and ritual groups to promote community-based tourism, among others.

6. Global trade plays a crucial role in shaping economies. While it has provided opportunities and better income for some, these benefits are unevenly distributed, with consumption regions in the Global North benefiting the most.  In addition, these benefits have often been achieved at the cost of negative impacts on ecosystems and human well-being. As a result – in many cases – Indigenous Peoples, local communities, farmers, and rural workers have lost access to vital ecosystem services and faced social conflicts that undermine their overall well-being. Some questions arise: if you benefit from a natural resource or a commodity, should you also take responsibility for its impact? The answer is increasingly clear: yes. Business operations can impact human well-being in several ways. Expanding mining activities or commodity production, for example, can displace Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their ancestral lands and territories. [Truly addressing the social impacts at extraction sites](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/how-to-safeguard-human-wellbeing-across-supply-chains) and across production supply chains requires factoring in broader dimensions of human well-being to business operations and project planning.

7. Every fall, one of the planet’s most extraordinary natural spectacles occurs amid the fir forests of central Mexico: Millions of monarch butterflies land here to find respite from the cooling winter temperatures in northeastern U.S. and Canada for their annual hibernation. This incredible event, a critical part of the monarchs’ life cycle, depends on Mexico’s forests. However, these forests are feeling the effects of global climate change. One of the effects is the rise of pests; a problem that is not unique to Mexico, forest pests are a growing threat in many other countries (for example, in 2024, WRI reported that forest pests are a growing threat to Europe’s forests). The Neovolcanic Axis Conservation Fund (FOCEN) and the technical monitoring partner Ambiomas Acciones y Respuestas Adaptativas (Ambiomas), with support from GFW and the Monarch Butterfly Fund, took a [multi-pronged approach to creating the early warning system](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/monitoring-forest-pests-mexico/). Realizing the time commitment of ground patrols and the limitations of satellite imagery, they incorporated multispectral drone technology that can capture data in multiple wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) to complement field visits and provide high-resolution imagery of forest degradation that satellites cannot always capture. Thanks to the early warning system, FOCEN, Ambiomas and communities have been able to take targeted action in controlling bark beetles — namely, removing infected trees and wood debris, in accordance with Mexican regulations for controlling and preventing beetle outbreaks. More monitoring is needed to determine whether the bark beetles are now contained, and local communities are currently conducting pest and forest disease monitoring surveys as part of FOCEN’s Best Management Practices Programs within their payment for ecosystem services program.

8. [A symphony for nature: the BES-Net regional trialogue for East and Southern Africa uniting science policy and practice](https://www.besnet.world/a-symphony-for-nature-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-east-and-southern-africa-uniting-science-policy-and-practice/), where biodiversity loss, invasive alien speciesand unsustainable use of wildlife are playingout like discordant notes. These challenges don’t exist in isolation; they are deeply intertwined with water, food, health and climate change. When invasive alien  species spread unchecked, they disrupt ecosystems, strain freshwater supplies, threaten agriculture, affect human health and destabilize local livelihoods. But what if we could harmonize solutions rather than tackling these crises in silos? The series of groundbreaking assessments produced by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) on the sustainable use of wild species (2022), IAS (2023) and nexus among biodiversity, water, food and health (2024) shed a critical spotlight on the profound interlinkages of these thematic issues. Equally encouraging is the presence of many communities already nurturing this balance for generations, relying on wildlife for food, income and cultural traditions. Guided by global evidence and inspired by local wisdom, the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network (BES-Net) brought together 70 experts, policymakers, Indigenous leaders and practitioners from Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe for a three-day Trialogue in Windhoek, Namibia to transform global knowledge into local action. The Trialogue also explored the theme of sustainable use of wildlife through a mix of panel discussions, interactive sessions and case studies. Country teams shared their experiences, uncovering governance models that work, gaps that persist and opportunities to scale up local successes. The role of Indigenous and local knowledge was front and centre, reinforcing the need for policies that weave diverse ways of knowing. 

9. [Forests, food and frequent satellite data for International Day of Forests 2025](https://www.planet.com/pulse/forests-food-and-frequent-satellite-data-for-international-day-of-forests-2025/). The pressing question is: How do we use technology to efficiently protect our forests from bushfires, wildlife poaching, unauthorized land conversions, and other illicit activities? [Forest health monitoring using satellite data](https://www.planet.com/industries/forestry/) offers a powerful, proactive, and practical approach, enabling governments and conservation organizations to effectively protect these invaluable resources. Planet satellite imagery and analytics can be used to spot early signs of deforestation before they escalate; track global deforestation trends and understand their impact; accurately measure forest cover loss with high-frequency imagery; strengthen bushfire response strategies using near-daily data; monitor wildlife populations to prevent poaching and habitat loss; manage reforestation projects remotely with updated insights; and estimate forest carbon levels to support carbon offset projects.

10. Without nature, businesses across the globe would be unable to operate. The production of goods, from electric cars to chocolate, relies on natural resources and ecosystem services, such as precious minerals and agricultural commodities like cocoa. Actions to improve the sustainability of business activities are most effective when embedded across the entire business. UNEP-WCMC's [Proteus Partnership](https://www.proteuspartners.org/) highlights that [every job is a nature job](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/every-job-is-nature-job-how-companies-can-protect-nature-and-build-resilience) and is developing a series of guides that enable different business functions to integrate nature into their decision-making. They provide companies with practical guidance on how business can empower nature-driven decision-making today, to build a resilient economy for tomorrow. Business and biodiversity are interconnected. Degraded ecosystems will struggle to provide the services on which the economy depends, such as food production or extraction of critical minerals for renewable technologies. Without these, supply chains will lose resilience as production is threatened by biodiversity risk. The [procurement brief](https://resources.unep-wcmc.org/products/WCMC_RT567) outlines the steps professionals with this function can take to support nature. Individuals working in a business's procurement department deal with the buying of goods and services for production. The brief provides these professionals with guidance on how they can consider nature when deciding on what to purchase. Actions in the guide range from ensuring contracting processes include nature-related criteria, to understanding industry standards. Guidance is provided on how business developers can engage with specialists and stakeholders to guarantee nature-related risks are considered and mitigated, and how to ensure the consideration of nature is incorporated throughout the final decision-making process.  

**Climate**
1. [Building climate expertise: fellowship programme empowers professionals from SIDS and LDCs](https://unfccc.int/news/building-climate-expertise-fellowship-programme-empowers-professionals-from-sids-and-ldcs) with hands-on experience and specialised training. Thanks to new funding from Portugal and Italy, more professionals can now contribute to global climate action while enhancing their expertise. Portugal’s funding specifically supports professionals from Portuguese-speaking SIDS and LDCs to work in the secretariat's Transparency Division, while Italy’s contribution funds fellowship opportunities in the Means of Implementation and Adaptation divisions. The initiative serves three core purposes: support innovative and analytical work on climate change within the framework of sustainable development; build a global network of creative experts tackling climate issues; and nurture the leadership potential of promising professionals in their respective fields.

2. Within 25 years, 3.3 million who live in the Arctic will lose their homes due to melting permafrost. As the Arctic heats at four times the global rate, this frozen ecosystem thaws, reshaping the landscape. Those who have lived on permafrost for generations now grapple with relocation as the ground sinks beneath them. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway synthesizes vast data on the location, condition, and extent of permafrost into digestible visualizations and analyses available to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. This [solution-oriented synthesis approach](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/collective-action-changing-arctic) is how NCEAS makes an immediate impact on communities affected by thawing permafrost. Engineering firms, for example, can use this information to decide where to safely relocate villages, and communities can use it to understand how much time they may have before they need to move. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway will not only help Alaskan villages adapt to a changing landscape but also inform international climate policy. This work makes permafrost change more prevalent in the consciousness of those working on climate issues, and in doing so, motivates action to halt further loss of this critical and underappreciated ecosystem.

3. Climate change has caused temperatures in the Kyrgyz Republic to rise at twice the global average, exacerbating [water stress and the risk of natural disasters](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/climate-change-reshaping-kyrgyz-republic-finds-new-unep-atlas), according to a new Atlas of Environmental Change launched today by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The average annual temperature in the country has increased by 1.2°C between 1960 and 2023— compared to a global average of 0.6°C. This rise is expected to speed up in the coming decades. Warmer temperatures mean that river flows are projected to decrease while demand for water increases. The Atlas data underlines the urgent need for strong climate adaptation policies to reduce irrigation losses, strengthen early warning systems, as well as to improve pasture management —70% of pastures in the country are estimated to be degraded. Climate change is furthermore increasing the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. On average, 200 emergencies are registered in the country each year, 90% of which are of a natural origin, such as flooding, earthquakes, mudslides, rockfalls and avalanches. In 2022, natural disasters resulted in nearly 150 people losing their lives and triggered annual average economic losses of $27 million between 2012-2018. Even as it faces these challenges, the country has made significant strides in environmental conservation, particularly in protecting its forests and wildlife. Since 2000, forest cover has increased from 6.2% to 6.9% of the Kyrgyz Republic due to afforestation, a difficult task in a country that is overwhelmingly mountainous. In 2000, protected areas made up only 0.5 million hectares of the country, but this increased to 1.5 million hectares by 2023. By 2040, protected areas are planned to cover as much as 10% of the country and protect 60–65% of the species included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. All forests in the country are legally protected from large-scale commercial logging and — thanks to the establishment of the Khan Teniri Nature Park — the area of protected land that is home to snow leopards in the Central Tien Shan mountains has been expanded by 40%. 

4. In Kochi, a major port on India's western coast, a dense network of rivers, creeks and canals was once the lifeline of the city. The waterways were a transport route for people and goods, provided water for daily use, and drained monsoon stormwaters into the sea. But many have been neglected in recent decades amid rapid urbanization, some unplanned. Buildings and bridges have encroached on the waterways, obstructing the flow. Untreated waste has polluted the increasingly stagnant waters. And invasive plants and mosquitos have replaced once-abundant fish and birds. Climate change is only adding to the problems: sea-level rise, extreme rainfall events and tidal surges have increased the risk of major flooding in the city, which is home to about 600,000 people. But a new effort by Kochi’s local authorities, supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is now underway to [restore the city’s waterways, which are seen as crucial to helping the city adapt to the changing climate](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/historic-canals-take-centre-stage-kochi-india-aims-blunt-fallout-climate). The project, which has already got residents dreaming of canals clean enough for swimming, is part of UNEP’s Generation Restoration Cities initiative to advance nature-based solutions to urgent environmental challenges in urban areas around the world.  

**Oceans**
1. The MSC has introduced a series of changes to its objections process, which came into effect at the end of February, for a pilot of 12 months, in response to feedback from different stakeholder groups and following a review of the MSC Assurance System. The [objections process](https://www.msc.org/what-you-can-do/engage-with-a-fishery-assessment/msc-objections-procedure-what-you-need-to-know) provides a route for stakeholders to challenge the outcome of a fishery assessment if they believe the independent assessor did not follow procedures correctly. Revisions are expected to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure objections can be resolved without immediate escalation to an adjudication hearing. The revisions will also align the process with those of other leading sustainability certification schemes. The MSC continues to welcome input in the [development of its Standards](https://www.msc.org/standards-and-certification/developing-our-standards) and encourages stakeholders to submit feedback and participate in formal reviews. There are also [multiple mechanisms which enable stakeholders to raise concerns](https://www.msc.org/complaints) about the conduct of a certificate holder, certification body, or the MSC itself.

2. The [Allen Coral Atlas will be funded for 2025 by two key organisations: the Anthropocene Institute and Global Conservation](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/global-conservation-and-anthropocene-institute-support-allen-coral-atlas-for-2025/). The Anthropocene Institute works towards the goals to make Earth abundant and sustainable for generations to come. Global Conservation trains, equips, and empowers people globally to advance their protection of wild spaces on land and in the sea. Combined, Anthropocene Institute and Global Conservation are providing critically needed resources to operate the Allen Coral Atlas this year. 

3. [Into the Deep: help decode ocean mysteries from your laptop](https://oceandecade.org/news/into-the-deep-help-decode-ocean-mysteries-from-your-laptop/). [Into the Deep is an online learning and citizen science platform](https://www.thedeepproject.eu/#) that invites participants, or citizen scientists, from around the world and with any level of science experience, to contribute to marine image analyses that feed into ongoing research projects. The platform hosts learning modules and a tailored participatory science tool around four distinct deep-sea marine habitats and the impact humans have had on them. By analyzing photos and identifying sea life, substrate, fish species and more, participants become empowered citizen scientists and contribute to the science we need for the ocean we want. Participants use a new web-based image analysis tool, known as BiiGLE PARTY, to make species observations in seafloor images. Results from the project show that users’ observations successfully feed into ongoing scientific research by ‘teaching’ machine learning tools to observe specific indicators amongst the thousands of images now collected by marine cruises and stationery marine observation modules. While contributing to science research, users gain a deeper understanding of marine conservation policy and agency through their participation. Marine scientists also gain a new understanding of how to communicate their research goals to the communities around them and understand the potential value of citizens as a resource. The outputs have also started to encourage more collaborations to protect our valuable marine ecosystems.

4. The identification and official registration of a new species can take up to 13.5 years—meaning some species may go extinct before they are even documented. To address this, The Nippon Foundation and Nekton jointly launched the Ocean Census in April 2023 to transform species discovery, accelerating the identification of marine life to close critical knowledge gaps before it’s too late. On the 10th of March 2025, The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, the world’s largest collaborative effort to accelerate the discovery of marine life, [announced the discovery of 866 new marine species](https://oceandecade.org/news/partner-news/the-ocean-census-discovers-over-800-new-marine-species/), including new species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, sponge, shrimp, crab, reef fish, squat lobster, pipehorse, limpet, hooded shrimp, sea spiders and brittle stars: a significant step in advancing our understanding of ocean biodiversity, with discoveries expected to grow as the programme continues. 

5. [Navigate with Care: Protect Our Oceans](https://ifan-maritime.org/navigate-with-care/). The International Foundation for Aids to Navigation and the Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation are joining forces to [promote safer, more sustainable boating](https://oceandecade.org/news/partnering-to-promote-safe-and-sustainable-boating/). Every year, vessels around the world inadvertently damage fragile marine ecosystems, often due to a lack of awareness or inadequate navigational planning. Groundings, propeller scarring, and improper anchoring harm coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds. The campaign will provide mariners with practical resources, including guidelines for safe navigation, educational materials and tips for avoiding sensitive marine areas.

6. [Ocean science in action: building a sustainable future for coastal cities](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-building-a-sustainable-future-for-coastal-cities/). Coastal cities are booming: over a third of the world’s population now lives within 100km of the sea. However, this expansion brings mounting challenges, from climate change-induced risks to human-driven environmental degradation. Ensuring these urban centers remain resilient while preserving marine ecosystems is a pressing global priority. Urban runoff, wastewater, and poorly planned development are reshaping coasts around the world — eroding wetlands, polluting seas, and contributing to ocean warming and acidification. As a result, only 15% of the world’s coastlines remain in their natural state. 3 Initiatives endorsed by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 are pioneering innovative solutions through science, technology, policy and community action. 1. Reviving Sydney Harbour: transforming urban seascape. The [World Harbour Seascape Restoration Programme](https://oceandecade.org/actions/world-harbour-seascape-restoration-programme/), led by the Sydney Institute of Marine Science, is working to restore this fractured marine ecosystem, proving that even in the most urbanized waters, marine life can make a comeback. Its [Project Restore](https://projectrestore.sims.org.au/) breaks away from traditional, one-habitat-at-a-time restoration to revive entire marine landscapes – bringing seagrasses, kelp forests, and reefs back to life as interconnected ecosystems. In a historic first, 3,000 shoots of the endangered *Posidonia australis* seagrass have been carefully transplanted into Sydney Harbour, laying the foundation for lush underwater meadows. In parallel, 16 tonnes of sea urchins have been removed from two sites where rocky reefs once flourished to allow Ecklonia radiata kelp forests to reclaim their rightful space. 2. Predicting and preventing pollution in port areas in Quebec and beyond, where artificial intelligence is used in preventing pollution spikes. Through the [Enviro-Actions Project](https://oceandecade.org/actions/preventive-management-of-industrial-port-zones-enviro-actions/), led by the Northern Institute for Research in Environment and Occupational Health and Safety, autonomous scientific buoys (floating sensors) and monitoring stations are tracking critical water and air quality data in near real-time. But this technology doesn’t just collect data, it then acts on it: when pollution levels rise, preventive alerts are issued to halt further contamination. The Project also measures underwater noise levels and analyzes long-term environmental trends to reveal the true impact of port operations. Enviro-Actions is not just a local initiative – it is currently being deployed to other coastal regions in Quebec such as at Saguenay, and it has the potential to be implemented in all industrial or port areas on the planet, setting a new standard for sustainable maritime operations. 3. Preparing for sea-level rise in coastal cities. Coastal communities are facing the alarming reality of sea-level rise, with some areas experiencing rates up to four times faster than the global average. Cities like Jakarta, Lagos, Houston, Rotterdam, and Venice could be submerged by the end of the century unless significant adaptive measures are taken. Led by the Ocean & Climate Platform, the [Sea’ties initiative](https://oceandecade.org/actions/seaties-sharing-solutions-with-coastal-cities-to-tackle-sea-level-rise/) is empowering coastal cities to tackle the challenges of sea-level rise head-on. It brought together over 280 stakeholders, from urban planners to scientists and elected officials, to create a global network focused on sharing challenges and leading practices of adaptation solutions. This grassroot approach led the foundation to the international advocacy and mobilisation the project conducted. One key achievement of the initiative is the Sea’ties Declaration, which has rallied more than 70 mayors and city networks around four priority themes: mobilizing science and observation systems for adaptation; integrating societal issues with adaptation plans; fostering adaptive and hybrid solutions; and boosting public funding and private investments.

7. In January 2025, over 400 observers across 36 countries witnessed one of the most extraordinary natural events: the synchronised spawning of *Porites rus*, a key tropical, reef-building coral which has been known to spawn in a predictable and synchronised manner in certain regions. After the discovery of the synchronised spawning in 2020, [Tama no te Tairoto](https://tamanotetairoto.org/) (children of the lagoon) worked to track these events across 18 islands, collecting 426 observations which confirmed the synchronisation  from French Polynesia to La Réunion Island, which lead to a fundamental question about reef connectivity: can coral species synchronize their reproduction on a global scale? Therefore, observers registered from 36 countries and territories, spanning from Costa Rica to the Red Sea, including regions like Fiji, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Kenya and Egypt. In total, more than 400 participants joined, demonstrating the [power of citizen science in tracking large-scale ecological processes](https://oceandecade.org/news/citizen-scientists-capture-coral-spawning-data-across-the-globe/). The results from the first wave of observations have already shown a fascinating discovery: the spawning of *Porites rus* occurred across vast distances, synchronized in a way that had never been observed before. Participants from French Polynesia reported the first sightings as early as 6:55 a.m. local time, with additional observations coming in from Mauritius, La Réunion Island, the Maldives and even as far as Chumbe Island in Tanzania, all within an hour and a half after sunrise at each location! This confirmed that *Porites rus* does indeed have the ability to synchronize its reproduction across great distances—exceeding 18,000 kilometers from one hemisphere to another.

8. [GenOcean](https://oceandecade.org/genocean/), an official Ocean Decade campaign, [focusing on citizen science](https://oceandecade.org/news/genocean-new-ocean-decade-campaign-highlighting-youth-citizen-scientists/) to collect, analyse and interpret data by tracking whale migrations, monitoring water quality and identifying marine life. Some of these projects are best suited for surfers, sailors or scuba divers, others are accessible to people anywhere in the world who have a laptop or a phone and an internet connection. GenOcean also features specific opportunities for young and emerging ocean advocates to become leaders in their communities through their local non-profit organizations and educational institutions. 

9. [Global Fishing Watch spotlights ocean governance successes](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-spotlights-ocean-governance-successes-highlighting-policy-wins-and-tech-innovations/), highlighting policy wins, tech innovations and critical breakthroughs in driving transparent and equitable ocean governance in their [2024 annual report](https://globalfishingwatch.org/annual-report-2024). Major strides across key initiatives were made: 900,000 vessels were tracked on the organisation's flagship map, 11 million gigabytes of satellite imagery were analysed and there were nearly 1,500 research citations. The past year also highlighted the broadening application of Global Fishing Watch tools beyond fisheries management, including in the climate and biodiversity spaces. Former United States Vice President Al Gore presented the [integration of Global Fishing Watch’s unique dataset into Climate TRACE’s platform](https://t.co/TbO4Q11t1P) which seeks to map and estimate the emissions of all ocean-faring industrial vessels. In addition, a [2024 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1950) led by the University of Washington and using Global Fishing Watch data made a breakthrough discovery in the biodiversity and marine protection space revealing that fewer than 7 percent of global hotspots for whale and ship collisions have protection measures in place.

10. On 25 February 2025, the Antarctic sea ice reached its minimum extent for the year, covering 1.87 million km2, according to Copernicus Marine data. This marks the seventh lowest minimum extent on record, tied with 2024, which is 8% below the 1993–2010 long-term average. Copernicus Marine provides key data to monitor these changes through parameters such as sea ice extent and thickness, which are analysed by Mercator Ocean International to provide insights into trends and patterns. According to their latest analysis, the minimum Antarctic sea ice extent for this year was reached on 25 February, at 1.87 million km2. Sea ice volume in the Antarctic has also reached near-record lows. On 5 March 2025, it reached its minimum, dropping to just 1,030 km³, a 56% decrease from the long-term average of 2,390 km³. This value is in line with the last four years, which were exceptionally low sea ice volume years. Sea ice volume refers to the total amount of ice present, considering both the surface area and the thickness of the ice. Unlike sea ice extent, which measures the total area covered by ice, monitoring the volume provides a more comprehensive view of the health and stability of the ice. A decrease in volume indicates not only a reduction in the area covered by ice, but also a thinning of the remaining ice, which is more susceptible to melting and ultimately accelerates the process of ice loss. The 2025 data confirm the [continuing decline of Antarctic sea ice](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-near-record-low-2025), with both extent and volume remaining well below historical averages. In recent years, Antarctic sea ice has consistently trended lower, with the minimum extents recorded since 2017 setting records as the five lowest extents since satellite records began 32 years ago. Notably, 2025 is also the second consecutive year with a sea ice minimum extent below 2 million km². Monitoring these shifts is key to understanding global ocean dynamics and climate trends, as changes in Antarctic sea ice influence global ocean currents, weather patterns, and ecosystems. 

11. As part of its adaptive management cycle, [California is considering proposed changes to its groundbreaking Network of marine protected areas (MPAs)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/seasketch-helps-stakeholders-explore-changes-mpas) through the California Fish and Game Commission’s (CFGC) petition process. [SeaSketch California](https://www.seasketch.org/california/app), an open-source marine spatial planning tool developed in the lab of NCEAS researcher Will McClintock, will provide a spatial tool for the public to interactively explore how the proposed changes modify the MPA Network. California’s marine protected areas are a network of discrete marine or estuarine areas in state waters designed to protect or conserve marine life and habitats. They encompass diverse ecosystems from beaches to offshore and seafloor habitats. Enacted into policy by the California Legislature in 1999 via the Marine Life Protection Act, and fully implemented in 2012, the MPA Network aims to protect the diversity of marine life and the habitats on which they depend. SeaSketch California has been customized to provide the public with access to the data that will be used to evaluate a set of petitions submitted by California Native American Tribes and members of the public that could modify parts of the MPA Network. SeaSketch California will allow interested stakeholders to visualize these changes and how they align with critical scientific guidelines and habitat protection goals.

12. With the [2025 United Nations Ocean Conference](https://unocnice2025.org/en/) just three months away, [80 newly endorsed Decade Actions are expanding the global Ocean Decade portfolio](https://oceandecade.org/news/accelerating-ocean-solutions-80-new-actions-fuel-the-ocean-decades-global-impact/) – now over 700 strong – driving ocean science in priority action areas across all ocean basins. From niche research to big-picture solutions, the 80 new Decade Actions cover a wide range of topics, including ocean prediction and coastal resilience to sustainable fisheries, ecosystem restoration, inclusive offshore renewable designs, and ocean journalism. Spanning 29 countries – from Chile and Indonesia to Pakistan, Malta, and Togo – they are primarily led by governmental and research institutions, as well as non-governmental and educational organizations.

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. The [Global Renewables Watch](https://www.globalrenewableswatch.org/), a living atlas mapping and measuring utility-scale solar and wind installations across the Earth, is [now live](https://www.planet.com/pulse/global-renewables-watch/) to the public. This data-rich platform is built on Planet’s PlanetScope basemaps, offering high-cadence satellite imagery dating back to 2018. With this time-series data, users can evaluate energy transitions country-by-country, monitor land-use changes, and track trends over time. With the robust technical capabilities of Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, and The Nature Conservancy’s scientific rigor, the insights delivered in this platform offer an enlightening glimpse of a rapidly changing world. 

2. GBIF has [enabled](https://www.gbif.org/news/5PapgYCsbHPe7UWmEQTc5a/better-than-the-original-new-sql-based-service-enables-download-of-occurrence-data-cubes) a New SQL-based service that enables download of [species occurrence data cubes](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence-cubes). The new data cube service standardizes access to biodiversity data for producing [Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)](https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/) as well as indicator workflows and models for climate and land use change created by [B-Cubed partners](https://b-cubed.eu/partners). Specific [case studies](https://b-cubed.eu/case-studies) will test the capacity of indicator workflows to capture relevant aspects of biodiversity change based on different policy targets. As with other GBIF occurrence download formats, all successful queries are assigned unique and permanent DOIs to enable FAIR citation that enable attribution of credit to data publishers and aid reproducibility of downstream analyses.

**Indices and indicators**
1. The [World Development Indicators (WDI)](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) serves as a premier source for cross-country and time-series development statistics. [Covering nearly 1,500 indicators for 217 economies](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/inside-the-world-development-indicators--how-do-we-select-the-in), WDI has grown substantially since it first appeared as a modest set of tables in the 1978 World Development Report. Over time, it has become an open, easily accessible resource for users worldwide, including economists, policymakers, social scientists, and practitioners in fields as diverse as health, poverty, climate, and education. What makes WDI particularly valuable is the quality, relevance, and breadth of its coverage of its indicators, which allows users to conduct cross-country comparisons, long-run analyses going back to the 1960s, and quick policy checks. Yet as global development challenges diversify and data production expands, the list of potential indicators to include in the WDI grows too. From energy and digital access to specialized labor market statistics, WDI receives more potential indicators to include every year. Ultimately, this is an opportunity to grow our body of data and knowledge. However, unchecked expansion risks lowering quality or confusing users. By setting clear criteria, 1. Ease of use: easily accessible, understandable, and interoperable; 2. Trusted and relevant: unbiased and confidential data collection; 3. Adequate coverage: covers a substantial number of economies over multiple years, representing the target population comprehensively; and 4. High quality: ensuring data accuracy and comparability over time and across geographies, the WDI team can check if a proposed indicator offers enough coverage, solid methods, user relevance, and ease of use. This keeps WDI as the go-to reference for global development data.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. In the evolving landscape of Open Access research, [ensuring that repositories and data sources meet high standards of quality and interoperability is crucial](https://www.openaire.eu/openaire-provide-new-validated-badge); [OpenAIRE PROVIDE](https://provide.openaire.eu/) plays a key role in this process by offering the "OpenAIRE Metadata Validator" to evaluate the compatibility level of data sources with the OpenAIRE Guidelines. The OpenAIRE validation process ensures that data sources adhere to [OpenAIRE’s guidelines](https://guidelines.openaire.eu/en/latest/), promoting consistency, accuracy, and interoperability of metadata. By passing this validation, data sources demonstrate their commitment to follow global standards to expose their metadata, enhancing the interoperability and quality of their content. Data sources that successfully meet OpenAIRE’s validation criteria can display the OpenAIRE Validated badge on their official website. This badge signals to researchers, institutions, and funders that the data source meets high standards for metadata quality and interoperability. Moreover, validated data sources are indexed in the OpenAIRE Graph, a vast, global interconnected research database, significantly improving discoverability and accessibility. Being validated by OpenAIRE ensures that a data source's content is more easily accessible to a global research community. This increases engagement, citation potential, and the overall impact of the research hosted within the data source.

2. [Shaping open infrastructures for responsible research assessment](https://www.openaire.eu/public-consultation-shaping-open-infrastructures-for-responsible-research-assessment) to support a fair, transparent, and responsible approach to research assessment. The [Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research Assessment: Principles and Framework](https://zenodo.org/records/14844582) is open for public consultation until March 14, 2025, and your feedback will help ensure it meets the needs of the global research community. The principles of Open Infrastructure are community governance (stakeholder-driven, inclusive decision-making that reflects scholarly diversity); transparency; openness (free access to data, metadata and software); sustainability (long-term financial stability); diversity (inclusive participation from all research communities); FAIR data; equity (universal access to research data and output); responsibility, integrity and accountability (reliable, ethically governed infrastructures); and innovation (adaptation to technical and social changes).

3. The [Biodiversity Data Journal](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) (BDJ) has become the [second scientific journal to take advantage of the GBIF hosted portals programme](https://www.gbif.org/news/6xd5bxWZxS6DriaVoVnFJ/biodiversity-data-journal-launches-gbif-hosted-portal), setting a key precedent for scientific publishers seeking to advance and support the reuse of FAIR biodiversity data using open infrastructure. The newly launched [portal](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) enables seamless integration of published articles and associated data elements with GBIF-mediated records, enhancing the visibility and dissemination of biodiversity data for authors and publishers. Users can explore more than 278,000 occurrence records across 837 datasets published to date through BDJ. 

4. The [Disentis Roadmap](https://www.bouchoutdeclaration.org/roadmap-2024/) has been [launched](https://plazi.org/posts/2025/03/the-disentis-roadmap/), a significant step towards providing access to data 'imprisoned' in scientific publications, in the sense that only humans can understand the content, and only if access to the publication is granted. Machines cannot read the data due to lack of access, standardization and other hurdles. With a corpus of over 500 million printed pages, a daily flood of new publications, and increasingly more powerful artificial intelligence-based tools, machine access is crucial for research, biodiversity conservation and an informed society. The Roadmap is a ten-year plan to liberate data from scientific publications and make biodiversity data an integral part of our daily knowledge. The Roadmap is based on the realization that we need to have full access to the scientific literature to write reports on the state of nature such as the IPBES reports, to expedite monitoring systems for biodiversity, understand nature in such basic terms as to provide a list of all the known species and access to all the knowledge about them.

5. The Amazon region is crucial for climate balance and biodiversity preservation. [DataMap/Amazon](https://datamap.pcs.usp.br/), an initiative of the Center for Sustainable Amazon Studies at the University of São Paulo (USP), promotes the production and dissemination of science for the sustainable development of the Amazon. It is a [comprehensive data platform designed to centralize and unify data discovery, visualization, and processing for research datasets](https://datacite.org/blog/advancing-research-through-datacites-global-access-fund-datamap-amazon-the-first-integrated-repository-of-scientific-atmospheric-data-from-the-amazon/), particularly atmospheric data. DataMap empowers researchers to find, analyze, and share datasets seamlessly by simplifying data access and reducing infrastructure complexity.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. [iClimateAction: advancing earth intelligence through collaboration and innovation](https://earthobservations.org/news/iclimateaction-advancing-earth-intelligence-through-collaboration-and-innovation). The climate crisis demands better coordination, stronger data  integration and actionable intelligence. Funded by the European Union, the iClimateAction initiative strengthens collaboration between the Global Climate Observing System, World Meteorological Organization and GEO to streamline how climate data is collected, managed and transformed into decision-ready insights. Through iClimateAction, GEO will advance 2 key initiatives: [the global heat resilience service](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-heat-resilience-service), helping cities protect public health with real-time intelligence, and [the Global Ecosystem Atlas](https://globalecosystemsatlas.org/), a first-of-its kind open resource, consolidating ecosystem data to support adaptation, mitigation and nature-based solutions.

2. [ARSET - the application of earth observations for assessing waterborne disease risk, an online course](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-application-earth-observations-assessing-waterborne-disease) from March 25 - 27, 2025. This two-part training will focus on describing and accessing remote sensing observations useful as water quality indicators of waterborne diseases, and will present case studies where remote sensing data are used to assess the likelihood of cholera outbreaks. 

3. [ARSET - introduction to NASA Earth Observations and tools for operational wildfire monitoring and management, an online course](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-introduction-nasa-earth-observations-and-tools-operational) from April 16 - 30, 2025. This three-part training will familiarize participants with the various modules available in the Fire Information for Resource Management System, explore the range of data and information available as well as the characteristics of satellite-based active fire detection, and provide hands-on experience that participants can apply to query, access and visualize the data in GIS and other applications.

4. Planet owns and operates the [largest fleet of Earth imaging satellites in history](https://www.planet.com/pulse/commercial-satellite-imagery-providers/), supporting three distinct constellations: PlanetScope®, which captures approximately 3 m resolution images of all of Earth's landmass at a near-daily basis; SkySat® and Pelican™, providing high-resolution data on a traditional tasking model, capable of capturing 50 cd imagery of a specific location on Earth multiple times per day; and Tanager™, delivering hyperspectral data at 30 m resolution with more than 400 spectral bands. Governments and businesses worldwide use Planet satellite imagery to optimize operations, drive growth, and achieve public benefits. Two significant examples are our collaborations with civil and national governments and global intelligence and defense organizations.

5. [Why Satellite Imagery Is Critical to Maritime Domain Awareness Solutions](https://www.planet.com/pulse/why-satellite-imagery-is-critical-to-maritime-domain-awareness-solutions/). From fishing to shipping to naval movements, maritime activity plays a considerable role in national security — and unauthorized or unrecognized activities contribute to geopolitical tension and uncertainty. Government agencies gather naval intelligence on a range of activities, including: illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; military and strategic infrastructure monitoring; illicit ship-to-ship transfers; and foreign military movements and operations. Planet satellites provide high-frequency images with global coverage, delivering a more complete picture than other visual surveillance techniques.

6. Our forests play a pivotal role in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change. [High-quality, regularly updated data on deforestation and carbon storage](https://www.planet.com/pulse/scaling-climate-impact-planet-partners-leverage-forest-carbon-monitoring-for-a-sustainable-future/) are crucial for the success of carbon markets and regulatory compliance. [Planet Forest Carbon Monitoring](https://www.planet.com/products/forest-carbon/) offers insights into global changes in canopy height, canopy cover, and aboveground carbon density, delivering quarterly updates at a 3-meter resolution. This level of detail enables stakeholders to detect subtle changes in forest structure, supporting accurate monitoring, reporting, and verification processes.

7. Coastal habitats, including marshes and wetlands, serve as lifelines for surrounding human communities and marine ecosystems. Maintaining the health of coastal zones is vital to sustaining biodiversity, ensuring food security, and promoting resilience against climate change. High-frequency Earth data and analytics from Planet help agencies regularly [monitor conditions in coastal environments, at any scale](https://www.planet.com/pulse/monitoring-coastal-habitats-that-support-local-communities-and-diverse-ecosystems-2/). This practice – known as broad area management – allows authorities to maximize efficiency and catch unexpected events early, reducing risk to ecosystems and communities.

8. The 10 Working Groups of FORCE11 that [started](https://force11.org/post/shape-the-future-of-scholarly-communications-join-force11-working-groups/) in February and will operate for 18 months, span a diverse set of areas in scholarly communications and research practices, from research data, books or peer review, to AI and metadata. Many of the [Working Groups](https://force11.org/active-groups/?mc_cid=58b5ccd7b8&mc_eid=3edfd27520) are actively recruiting members. 

9. The United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation – a critical moment to spotlight the rapid loss of mountain glaciers and snowpacks, and the urgent need to support the ecosystems and people who depend on them. Right now, Earth’s mountain glaciers and snowpacks are undergoing rapid and widespread decline, reshaping water availability, altering ecosystems, and impacting livelihoods at an accelerating pace. Given current trajectories in greenhouse gas emissions and the exacerbated climate-related impacts associated with it, the continuation of these trends is largely inevitable, there are signs of hope. GEO Mountains supports activities that can equip mountain communities, researchers, and practitioners including government agencies environment managers with the data and tools they need to make [informed decisions on adaption and build resilience in the face of an uncertain future](https://earthobservations.org/news/adapting-inevitable-how-data-can-drive-resilience-mountain-regions).

10. Europe is taking control of its digital future by [building open, trustworthy and multilingual Large Language Models](https://www.openaire.eu/llms4europe-launches-europe-builds-its-own-fine-tuned-large-language-models-for-key-sectors) tailored to European needs, for 5 strategic sectors: energy, telecommunications, tourism, public services and science. These models will support multilingual literature discovery, evidence synthesis, and automated policy briefs in areas such as life sciences and social sciences. Crucially, the pilot connects to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), leveraging Europe’s open science infrastructure to access, process, and validate scientific knowledge. OpenAIRE leads efforts to mobilise trusted, multilingual content from repositories, publishers, and scholarly societies, effectively building a Data Space connector to power the fine-tuned LLM models with FAIR and verified data. It will also co-develop applications to test the factual reliability of outputs, ensuring that AI tools for science remain transparent and accountable.

**Biodiversity**
1. The 20th edition of the World Economic Forum's [Global Risks Report](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/) lands with a stark warning: the planet is in peril. Topping the 10-year risk rankings are extreme weather events, the relentless loss of biodiversity, collapsing ecosystems and critical shifts in Earth's systems - threats that demand urgent attention. The [unravelling of Earth's ecosystems is perhaps the most insidious threat, yet it is often lost in translation](https://earthobservations.org/news/flying-blind-how-disrupting-ecosystems-puts-everything-risk). To understand the danger, think of Earth's ecosystems as a Boeing 747 aircraft - a complex and beautiful piece of engineering with 6 million parts, all working together to keep it in the air. On a 747, every part, every screw, has a defined role - a role which only it can do to help keep the plane in the air. Sure, you might still be able to fly if you take out just one screw, but there will be consequences. It's the same with ecosystems. Every species is optimally fitted for a specific function - if you remove one species, something else must then do that job, normally at a far lower efficiency. Removing or damaging parts puts increased stress on other parts of the system. Damage can cascade rapidly, driving an ecosystem to the brink of collapse - like a vibrant coral reef teeming with life deteriorating into an algae-covered grave.

2. The European Union (EU) awarded the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) EUR 27 million to [tackle organised crime networks trafficking in wildlife globally and reduce the demand driving this illicit trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-european-union-guard-wildlife-initiative-2025), in collaboration with civil society organizations. The new initiative, GUARD Wildlife - Global United Action to Reduce and Dismantle Organized Wildlife Crime - aims to conserve endangered species and biodiversity for future generations. GUARD Wildlife will enhance coordinated responses to combat wildlife crime at the national, regional and international levels and reduce illicit trafficking in wildlife and wildlife products in source, transit and destination countries. The initiative will unite key players to improve collaboration and strengthen information sharing. Efforts will also focus on bolstering national enforcement systems, including customs, police and border control, by providing expert mentorship and targeted support. Additionally, innovative demand-reduction efforts grounded in behavioural science will be implemented in consumer markets.

3. Operation Thunder 2024, which was held from the 11th of November to the 6th of December, brought police, customs, border control, forestry and wildlife officials from 138 countries and regions, together, marking the widest participation since the first edition in 2017, and resulted in the [seizing of nearly 20,000 live animals, all endangered or protected species](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-operation-thunder-2024). 365 suspects were arrested, and 6 transnational criminal networks suspected of trafficking animals and plants protected by CITES were identified. The live animals, which included big cats, birds, pangolins, primates and reptiles were rescued in connection with 2,213 seizures made worldwide. Where possible, wildlife forensic experts collected DNA samples before transferring the animals to conservation centres, where their health was assessed while awaiting repatriation or rehabilitation, in line with national frameworks and relevant protocols. The collection of DNA is a crucial part of supporting prosecutions, as it helps confirm the type of species and its origin or distribution, shedding light on new trafficking routes and emerging trends. In addition to the live animals, participating countries seized hundreds of thousands of protected animal parts and derivatives, trees, plants, marine life and arthropods. More than 100 companies involved in the trafficking of protected species were also identified.

4. [Call for nominations for the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award is open](https://www.gbif.org/news/4AAE2KOKBRJ0iS2DE2fT65/call-for-nominations-opens-for-2025-gbif-graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to highlight innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master's and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data. The 2025 programme will provide two €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers. Candidates receive formal nominations from the node managers and heads of delegation from GBIF Participant countries, who generally select one master's and one PhD candidate whose nominations are then forwarded to the GBIF Secretariat. Candidates must be either a citizen of a country participating in GBIF or a student at an institution located in a GBIF participant country. National node managers and/or heads of delegation may submit 2 nominees per country by the 27th of June 2025. The country deadlines vary, the earliest known deadline is the 24th of May in Mexico and South Africa.

5. World Wetlands Day was held on the 2nd of February, with the theme '[Protecting wetlands for our common future](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2740)', to remind us of the benefits wetlands provide for biodiversity and human wellbeing: wetlands help us cope with the impacts of climate change and secure critical freshwater resources. Wetlands are protected under many conservation instruments, many have been recognised not only as Ramsar sites, but also as UNESCO World Heritage properties and Biosphere Reserves, yet they are among the planet's most threatened ecosystems. 

6. Cocoa production has been linked to high rates of deforestation and biodiversity loss, making it a significant contributor to environmental degradation. Addressing and mitigating these negative impacts is essential for [achieving a more sustainable cocoa supply chain](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/ecom-reducing-deforestation-cocoa-supply-chain/). ECOM, one of the world's largest cocoa traders and processors that sources from over 30 countries, has made it a priority to reduce the negative impacts from their operations. One way to do that is by applying a standardised [methodology](https://www.wri.org/research/mapping-cocoa-assessing-deforestation-risk-cocoa-cote-divoire-ghana) developed by the World Resources Institute to ensure the cocoa beans they use are sustainably sourced and are not linked to forest loss. ECOM adapted its methodology to carry out widespread risk assessment in a standardised manner, expanding the model to other geographies and analysing data from Cameroon, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, Mexico, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Vietnam and Uganda. Once high-risk areas have been identified, ECOM works with smallholder farmers to proactively tackle cocoa-linked deforestation, focusing on prevention through strategies like sensitization training or Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs. The focus on high-risk locations enables further engagement with farmers and remediation to avoid excluding them from the supply chain, which can lead to worse outcomes and accelerate deforestation.

**Climate**
1. The [Egyptian Carbon Center has been named an Accelerator for the Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/egyptian-carbon-center-appointed-accelerator-for-the-race-to-zero/), a key role that highlights its leadership in carbon management and sustainability. This partnership aims to accelerate the decarbonization efforts of companies worldwide, providing them with essential tools and guidance to achieve net zero emissions. As an Accelerator, the Egyptian Carbon Center will offer companies access to cutting-edge resources and tailored strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. This collaboration supports businesses in setting ambitious climate goals, implementing effective decarbonization practices, and fostering long-term environmental and economic benefits. Partnering with the Egyptian Carbon Center will help companies drive innovation and enhance competitiveness by adopting green technologies.

2. It is widely acknowledged that the world needs to move away from its dependence on fossil fuels. However, the shift to renewable sources is not without its own environmental and social impacts. Experts at UNEP-WCMC have co-authored a [new working paper](https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/critical-transitions-circularity-equity-and-responsibility-quest-energy) that examines the potential costs of the green energy transition. The need for an energy transition is clear, and is reflected in the rapid growth of renewable energy industries in recent years (between 2011 and 2023, renewable energy production capacity increased five-fold). However, [moving from fossil fuels to these alternative sources is not straightforward](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/the-green-energy-transition-and-mining); it requires a vast amount of natural resources in order to build and develop the infrastructure. Furthermore, there is a risk of exacerbating existing inequalities: with nearly three-quarters of the world's population currently lacking access to electricity, we must ensure that people are not left behind. As the working paper points out, there are significant hurdles to overcome to meet the unprecedented demand for critical minerals. Distribution of these resources is concentrated in specific regions around the world, and so supply can be vulnerable to trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, it takes around 16 years on average to fully establish a new mining operation, and this can be much longer as a result of the unpredictable factors outlined above. Another issue is quality: as many of the world's easily accessible mineral deposits have already been mined, average grades of minerals (that is, the amount of metal within the ore body) are declining. This means that more rock needs to be mined to produce the same amount of metal, which in turn means more energy is used. Beyond these supply issues, there are pressing concerns about the wider environmental and social impacts of mining processes. Some of these are direct and obvious. For example, clearing land for extraction and processing operations destroys wildlife habitats and displaces local communities. Similarly, the chemicals used in processing create air and water pollution which can harm the health of both animal and human populations.

**Oceans**
1. Argo, the global network of autonomous floats that revolutionized ocean observation, marked its 25th anniversary in December. Since its inception, Argos has grown into a fleet of nearly 4,000 robotic floats, drifting with ocean currents and conducting dives of up to 6,000 meters. These floats collect critical data that contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), allowing us to [better understand changes in ocean heat, sea level rise, and circulation, improve weather and extreme event forecasts, and help society manage and adapt to climate change](https://goosocean.org/news/celebrating-25-years-of-argo-a-pillar-of-the-global-ocean-observing-system/). 

2. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps, a [reliable marine biodiversity foresight solution](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/23/species-distribution-maps/), is an important tool for Ocean protection. Using cutting-edge model-based capacities, the [OBIS Species Distribution Maps](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/) allows marine planners and decision-makers to identify, better manage and protect the biodiversity-rich areas of tomorrow's Ocean. Developed as a key component of the ambitious EU-funded MPA Europe project, the OBIS Species Distribution Map brings many advances, such as the integration of the five latest IPCC climate change scenarios, at an unparalleled resolution. As a marine biodiversity foresight solution, the OBIS Species Distribution Map fully supports crucial global biodiversity objectives such as achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework “30x30” target. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps are at the heart of the MPA Europe project's innovative approach. The project integrates blue carbon storage estimations, ocean connectivity, climate velocity, and marine biodiversity predictions into a prioritization tool, providing a holistic vision that supports decision-makers in implementing future Marine Protected Areas. This holistic approach translated into a challenging requirement for the OBIS team to match the project's ambitions.

3. Over the past year, data from the Copernicus Marine Service has been at the forefront of a [collaboration between Ocean Energy Europe and Mercator Ocean International](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/data-innovation-copernicus-marine-and-ocean-energy). This collaboration has showcased the impactful role Copernicus Marine has played in advancing the ocean energy sector. The collaboration aimed to bridge the gap between data providers and the industry by highlighting the practical applications of free, high-resolution ocean data in renewable energy development. By providing detailed information on ocean conditions such as currents, wave height, and salinity, this service supports decision-making at every stage of project development - from site selection to operations and maintenance. A key milestone of the collaboration was the identification and promotion of five use cases: 1. [CorPower Ocean: identifying global wave energy potential & projecting future energy systems](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/identifying-global-wave-energy-potential), 2. [Mocean Energy: optimising wave energy: Copernicus Marine Data for site selection and performance](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/optimising-wave-energy), 3. [MESPAC: Innovative solutions for offshore energy: MESPAC's AI-powered data enhancement](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/offshore-energy-mespacs-ai-powered-data), 4. [IMDC: the iMED model supporting Ocean Energy in the Mediterranean](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/supporting-Ocean-Energy-in-Mediterranean), and 5. [Minesto: harnessing predictable tidal energy in the Faroe Islands](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/harnessing-predictable-tidal-energy-faroe-islands). 

4. [The Copernicus Marine Service 2 (2021 - 2028) will start the second phase of its operations from 2025 to 2028, building on the success of Phase 1](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-2-enters-its-second-phase). The Copernicus Marine Service has expanded rapidly with a significant rise in user uptake. Phase 1 of Copernicus 2 (2021-2024) saw more than 88,000 users register for the service, growing by 30% on an annual basis. Similarly, the Copernicus Marine website attracts 1.5 million individual visitors each year, a 52% rise in unique visitors since 2023. The second phase of the Copernicus Marine Service 2 will focus on improving the service to maintain and reinforce its position as a world-leading marine monitoring service. Evolutions of Thematic Assembly Centres and Monitoring Forecasting Centres products will include the integration of new satellite missions (e.g. SWOT) and in situ observations, better processing techniques, models, coupling and data assimilation and an increasing use of Artificial Intelligence.

5. The Copernicus Marine Service is committed to continuously improving the quality and fitness-for-purpose of the design of its products and services. In line with these efforts, twelve downstream services have been [launched](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-new-projects-improve-coastal-monitoring-and-support-eu) as pilot demonstrations for EU Coastal Monitoring activities. The 12 funded projects are expected to deliver significant value to users, strengthen collaboration with national marine and coastal initiatives, and showcase the practical applications and benefits of Copernicus Marine data. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. Freshwaters are some of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet, and insufficient data availability contributes to challenges in conserving these essential environments. To support freshwater data holders, GBIF has [released](https://www.gbif.org/news/m6FopQ34VB8Bxcw2stU1T/new-guide-released-to-support-freshwater-data-publishing) the [Freshwater Data Publishing Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-sw3k-w725) to better support data-intensive research, policy, and management of these environments. This guide is part of a [series of digital documentation guides](https://www.gbif.org/training#_gbif-digital-guides) currently open for community peer review.

**News and updates about applications**
1. The latest update of the Copernicus Marine [MyOcean Pro Viewer](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/myocean-viewer), v.13, an interactive online tool that allows users to visualise and download Copernicus Marine data, has been [released](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/myocean-pro-viewer-update-situ-data-and-streamline-visualisation). It provides an intuitive interface to explore a wide range of oceanographic datasets, including satellite observations, numerical models, and in situ measurements. With this update, the MyOcean Pro Viewer now enables users to explore in situ observations collected from a series of geo-referenced platforms, such as floats, drifters, and gliders. When selecting an in situ platform, users can now access detailed information, along with time series or profile graphs. Moreover, the Viewer now allows users to combine graphs from different platforms into a single interface. This streamlined capability makes it easy to compare measurements such as temperature, salinity, and currents across various locations. These features make the access to in situ data, which are essential for understanding regional ocean dynamics, easier, more intuitive, and suitable for a wide range of user needs.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt) (EJT) — a leading electronic open-access journal for taxonomic research — has become the first scientific journal to [launch](https://www.gbif.org/news/2JHV6IsWcUUrD57I3FgXIQ/european-journal-of-taxonomy-launches-gbif-hosted-portal) a [GBIF hosted portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/), paving the way for other academic publishers to participate in the programme. This marks a move to elevate the access, reuse and interoperability of [material citations](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/a064f300-1bc8-41ea-9364-b864ef4e8938), traditionally confined within PDFs, that are now disseminated through published datasets. Users can explore features such as [data clustering](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/occurrence/search/?view=CLUSTERS) which enables discovery of potentially related occurrences by identifying related type specimens and linkages between records from different sources. This feature in combination with powerful [search tools](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/occurrence/search/) and [dashboard visualization](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/dashboard/) extends the reach of occurrences in GBIF to taxonomic treatments and publications through the [EJT portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/).

2. [FAIRsharing and FIPs (FAIR implementation profiles): where we are, where we are headed](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=971). At the core of putting FAIR in practice are the choices that have to be made when selecting the appropriate standards (i.e., terminologies, models, formats, minimal information requirements, and identifier schema) and databases (repositories and knowledge bases). These resources are essential to describe, report and identify, as well as share research objects (e.g., datasets, code, workflows). Often each project, group or organisation (i.e., community) has its own norms. To map this landscape, the concept of the FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) was created in 2019 together with ENVRI-FAIR and developed in a series of projects guided by the GO FAIR Foundation, to represent a collection of declarations a community makes about the usage of FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), including standards, services and policies. Across all disciplines, however, there are thousands of standards, databases and policies, which are core FERs; and this is where [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) comes in. An informative and educational service on standards, inter-related to databases and data policies, across all disciplines, FAIRsharing guides consumers and producers to discover, select and use these resources with confidence, producers to make their resource more discoverable, more widely adopted and cited. The description of these resources are curated and tagged according to the maturity (i.e., ready, in development, deprecated, uncertain) to reflect their very dynamic evolution. [FIP Wizard](https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org/) is specialised for the creation of FIPs, and provides templates organised as questionnaires. The integration of the FIP Wizard with FAIRsharing makes use of its rich content.

3. Ecological monitoring data, whether gathered through traditional on-the-ground surveys or emerging approaches around sensor networks, forms the gold standard for understanding biodiversity on a changing planet. However, the lack of a standardized way of collecting such essential information about methods has limited its reuse, leaving researchers and practitioners unable to leverage the power of survey datasets to monitor changing biodiversity trends. [Survey and Monitoring Data Quick-Start Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-7t3p-ve38): A how-to for updating a Darwin Core dataset using the Humboldt Extension takes a [key step toward closing this gap](https://www.gbif.org/news/17fTMFas4AhM3tvzPvp882/enhancing-discovery-and-reuse-of-survey-and-monitoring-data-with-new-guide). The standardized vocabulary of 55 new terms that Humboldt introduces allows data publishers to capture consistent contextual information about survey and monitoring activities and maximize the reusability of the resulting records.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. Beds of iceplant, dotted with daisy-like flowers, carpet the roadside and bluffs of coastal California. Although they look beautiful, this familiar plant is an invader: it chokes out native plants and salts the earth beneath it, it prevents sand from moving on the wind to replenish beaches and dunes. NCEAS researchers are collaborating with NASA and The Nature Conservatory to develop a comprehensive map of iceplant. To eradicate invasive species, land managers need to know where it grows. With NASA's support, the project will use [deep learning to combine satellite, airplane and drone images into a single comprehensive map](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/mapping-invader). The Nature Conservatory has begun treating the first 300 acres of iceplant (from an estimated 1,000 acres across the Dangermond Preserve in California), as as the project progresses, ongoing mapping will guide to where iceplant might hide among native vegetation or where it may have resurged.

2. In three months, from the 5th to the 9th of May, [Rome will welcome Earth observations experts, academics, industry leaders and policymakers](https://earthobservations.org/news/rome-gears-geo-global-forum-2025-where-global-leaders-will-shape-future-earth-intelligence) from around the world for the [GEO Global Forum 2025](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025). Data-driven solutions have the power to change how we understand and care for the planet: helping farmers adopt more efficient and sustainable practices, communities adapt to the climate crisis and businesses innovate. But to truly unlock this potential, we must turn data into action with solutions that pair advanced technology with human empathy, ethics and experience,because technology alone won't solve the climate and nature crisis, according to Yana Gevorgyan, Director of the GEO Secretariat. A high-level ministerial meeting will bring leaders together to agree on practical steps for using Earth Intelligence to achieve net-zero and nature-positive goals, build resilience to extreme heat and deliver early warnings for all. The Plenary will also include a pledging event to secure political and financial commitments for the implementation of GEO’s Post-2025 Strategy. Additionally, youth leaders will take centre stage, highlighting GEO’s ongoing commitment to intergenerational collaboration.

3. IMB, C40 Cities and the Group of Earth Observations announced a new collaboration aimed at scaling up social innovation action in cities around the world. In alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the new project will develop [artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to advance city resiliency and address specific challenges facing urban communities](https://earthobservations.org/news/ibm-c40-cities-and-group-earth-observations-collaborate-new-ai-project-resilient-cities). With support from the Group on Earth Observations , IBM and C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities, will work together to create a data-driven, AI-powered solution to help cities analyze potential risks that may arise as a result of extreme heat and the urban heat island effect. These can include stressed energy resources, increases in mortality rates, and socioeconomic disparities. The new solution will aim to enable cities to create adaptation strategies to help alleviate population health risks and economic burdens, while strengthening national resilience efforts.

4. Agriculture, forestry, and land use emissions have a notable influence on global climate change, contributing 26% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In response, environmental policies increasingly require sustainable agricultural practices like [carbon farming, which maximize carbon sequestration](https://www.planet.com/pulse/a-guide-to-carbon-farming-and-what-it-means-for-global-sustainability-efforts/). But confirming compliance with evolving mandates can be challenging. Manual data collection is costly and time consuming, making it difficult to scale operations to meet new requirements. With high-frequency satellite data and analytics, agencies can detect and monitor agricultural activity, at scale. Let's explore how this practice, known as broad area management, helps stakeholders quantify change within agricultural parcels, verify compliance, and work towards emission reduction targets. Carbon farming, also known as regenerative agriculture, aims to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil, by maximizing plant growth and minimizing soil disturbance. When plants die, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is either released back into the atmosphere or stored for long periods of time in the soil. Many conventional agriculture practices, such as tilling, result in the release of carbon. However, practices classified under carbon farming aim to do the opposite, by putting carbon back into the soil and keeping it there: no-till farming: avoiding plowing and tilling to minimise soil disturbance and erosion; crop rotation and intercropping: diversifying crops to improve soil health; planting cover crops: growing crops to cover the soil rather than for harvesting; and agroforestry: integrating trees and shrubs into crop fields to improve soil structure and keep carbon in the ground.

5. [Tutorial using Google Earth Engine with GBIF mediated occurrences](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/2025-01-23-time-series-of-land-surface-temperature/): exploring how to integrate remote sensing data with biodiversity observations to analyse the relationships between environmental factors and species occurrence, following an example of analysing the Land Surface Temperature over time and its relationship to observations of the songbird the Northern Cardinal. 

6. Since 2016, over 3,600 scientific publications using Planet data have been published, showcasing Planet data's widespread impact across a variety of disciplines in both industry and academia. The constant stream of new research makes digesting these insights a significant challenge—just last year, two new manuscripts were published every day. To help synthesize the vast amounts of published research, a large language model (LLM) was used to [explore whether cutting-edge AI technologies can assist in extracting insights on Planet data usage and applications](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ai-enabled-insights-from-publications-leveraging-planet-data/) from our growing publication database. With a focus on identifying the contexts (e.g., agriculture, forestry, environmental monitoring) in which the data is applied, the most frequently used data products, and the geographies of both the study authors and their study regions. As researchers drive new discoveries with Planet data and share through scientific publications, we expect AI tools to accelerate insights and enhance collaboration across disciplines. The model correctly extracted answers for most of the questions and manuscripts, with 90% accuracy for most of the manuscripts, the highest error rate (4.2%) occurred when identifying the type of product used (e.g., PlanetScope Imagery, Basemaps, Fusion). This challenge arises because authors may refer to Planet Basemaps simply as 'Planet Imagery' or use different terms for PlanetScope Imagery, such as 'Dove Imagery', 'CubeSats Imagery', or 'SuperDove Imagery'.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**

[Highlighting the worldviews and voices of African Indigenous Peoples at the BES-Net Regional Trialogue for West and Central Africa](https://www.besnet.world/highlighting-the-worldviews-and-voices-of-african-indigenous-peoples-at-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-west-and-central-africa/). The Trialogue was structured around specific and multi-stakeholder objectives: contextualizing knowledge, addressing issues related to invasive alien species and the sustainable use of wild species to enhance food security and human well-being, analysing the challenges of implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The central question of the meeting was: "How can we reconcile this very specific scale of local terrain with the scale of national policy - as well as for the UN on a global scale - in order to ensure the stability of the planet and our ability to manage ecosystems well, while taking into account the different realities experienced in relationships with nature?"

2. New [WWF-led research](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-led-research-highlights-invisible-wildlife-benefits-people-receive-but-could-lose-if-biodiversity-crisis-ignored), which has been [published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44358-024-00006-9), reveals that the vital benefits wildlife provides to people's everyday lives are vastly underrepresented across science and policy discussions. This oversight could have detrimental consequences for achieving global conservation targets. The concept of Nature's Contributions to People is well-established in science, business and policy, and it is often assumed that protecting a habitat or ecosystem will automatically preserve the benefits people rely on. Out of 18 NCP categories, as defined by IPBES, the study found that at least 12 are directly supported by wildlife, ranging from material benefits, such as food and livelihoods from fish or game species, to non-material values including ecotourism, medicinal uses, and a sense of identity or well-being. Long-term loss of wildlife will lead to declines in its contributions to people and ultimately harm people's wellbeing. A well-known example is the case of the North American sea otters. The 19th century fur trade led to a loss of the otter populations, after which an explosion in sea urchins destroyed kelp forests. This had severe consequences for fish populations, local fishing communities, and coastal ecosystems, making the area more vulnerable to storms and erosion and reducing the resources available to Indigenous communities that relied on kelp.

3. IUCN Save Our Species and the International Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme supported [vital projects that supported local communities, and protected threatened species as well as their habitats](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2024-our-year-in-review/), translating global goals into concrete action to support community conservation action. Some of the highlights of 2024 include: 2 calls for proposals: the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund with a focus on threatened ungulates, and SOS Lemurs; the SOS African Wildlife Initiative lessons learned workshop on achievements, shared lessons and explored strategies for human-wildlife conflict mitigation, biodiversity monitoring and community engagement; 2 reports, the [Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme on 10 years of tiger conservation](https://iucnsos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IUCN-ITHCP-150pdi-Spreads-DIGITAL.pdf) and an [impact report on the SOS African Wildlife initiative's rapid action grants](https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/iucn-celebrates-10-impactful-years-tiger-conservation-new-report) which showed that the €3.8 million investment across 23 African countries resulted in the protection of 58 threatened species.

4. New [natural forest data on Global Forest Watch](https://gfw.global/4fQfl03) from the [Science Based Target Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/) Natural Lands Map can help shed light on where the world's natural forests are located and provide a baseline for monitoring loss within them since 2020. The map, developed through a collaboration of Land & Carbon Lab, WWF and Systemiq, supports companies who have committed to eliminate conversion of natural lands in their supply chains through targets set with the SBTN land sector framework.

**Climate**
1. The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2024 annual global climate report](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202413); 2024 is officially the planet's [warmest year on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record). The 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. Additionally, the Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to its second-lowest extent on record, as well as the upper ocean heat content, the amount of heat stored in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, was the highest on record. Ocean heat content is a key climate indicator because the ocean stores 90% of the excess heat in the Earth system, and the five highest values have all occurred in the last five years.

2. [Wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area since the 7th of January](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained), displacing tens of thousands of people and destroying large areas. While California is no stranger to summer wildfires (typically starting in June and continuing through October when the weather is hot and dry), this January outbreak is an outlier, fueled by unusually severe fire weather conditions across the state's southern region. During most years, no fire alerts are detected in Los Angeles in the first three months of the year. Only in 2021, one of the most devastating years regarding wildfires in California, more than 10 fire alerts had been detected between January and March. In 2025, over 170 fire alerts had been detected by the 13th of January. 

3. The United Kingdom Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is leading a [significant 5-year research initiative](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/international-science-net-zero-plus), focussing on the effects of climate change on air and water quality, land use, and estimating the potential for greenhouse gas removal. To expand the accessibility of the program's digital outputs beyond academic papers and reports, UKCEH has chosen the [online platform MapX for wider dissemination](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/adsfoiuv9). 

**Oceans**
1. The [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network is playing a crucial role in understanding and protecting the vital ecosystem of the Northern California Current](https://marinebon.org/the-marine-biodiversity-network-keeps-an-eye-on-the-california-current/). Researchers and agencies are being brought together, and MBON is facilitating collaboration and data sharing, enabling scientists to study the current dynamics more effectively. As the current delivers cool water from the north (British Columbia), wind driven upwelling brings colder, nutrient-rich water from the ocean depths up to the surface. Those nutrients give a boost to marine phytoplankton that feed whales, seals, seabirds and other wildlife, as well as the iconic seafood of the Oregon coast and the fishing communities that depend on them. Understanding the past and present of the current, will enable everyone depending on it to be as ready as possible for an uncertain future.

2. A new study, [published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4541-3), has found that ocean warming in 2024 has led to [new record high temperatures](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sea-surface-and-deeper-water-temperatures-reached-new-record-high-2024) and discusses how a hotter ocean affects our lives on land and what this means for our future. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 meters ocean heat content increased by 16 zettajoules, which was approximately 40 times the world's total electricity generation in 2023. Ocean heat is the best measurement to monitor climate change. Increasing ocean heat content affects marine ecosystems, currents, sea ice, the way water separates into layers, climate variation and evolution, global weather systems, ocean-atmosphere interactions, sea level, the ocean's carbon cycle, oxygen levels, and human livelihoods. 

3. The Copernicus Marine Service [announced](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-release-copernicus-marine-toolbox) the latest major release of the [Copernicus Marine Toolbox](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/collections/9080063-copernicus-marine-toolbox), bringing a host of enhancements, such as a greater flexibility for integrating with diverse workflows, from high-performance computing systems to lightweight solutions like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.

4. International networks, citizen science initiatives, research institutes, universities and NGOs [working on marine biodiversity data are invited to participate in the DTO Bioflow second open call for marine biodiversity (monitoring) data](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/17/eudto-2ndcall/). These calls invite institutions to contribute to the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO) by making their data available through EMODnet Biology, a portal providing open, free access to interoperable data on the temporal and spatial distribution of marine species (e.g., angiosperms, benthos, birds, fish, macroalgae, mammals, reptiles, phyto- and zooplankton) from European regional seas. EMODnet runs the European OBIS node, so data in EMODnet also flows to the global OBIS data platform. Selected participants will receive funding of up to €60,000 per institution to support integrating their data into the EU DTO. The [submission deadline is the 28th of February 2025](https://dto-bioflow.eu/second-open-call-marine-biodiversity-data).

5. As the Ocean Decade enters its midpoint, [a new batch of 39 Decade Actions is setting the stage for transformative ocean solutions](https://oceandecade.org/news/wave-of-new-ocean-decade-actions-launch-the-year-ahead/), driving ocean sustainability worldwide. The new initiatives address ocean pollution, coastal resilience, hands-on citizen science, and a sustainable ocean economy. 

6. At the end of 2024, [51 IOI Ocean Academy courses have been delivered](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-ioi-ocean-academy-another-successful-year-of-outreach-and-global-growth-with-51-ioi-ocean-academy-courses-successfully-delivered-in-16-languages/) globally by the IOI Ocean Academy Directors. The programmes were offered in 16 local languages and dialects: Arabic, Dhivehi, English, French, Georgian, Hindi, Kiswahili, Marathi, Portuguese, Sinhala, Spanish, Thai, Tunesian Dialect, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu.  

7. The BNP Paribas Foundation [launches a new 'climate and biodiversity initiative' call](https://oceandecade.org/news/bnp-paribas-foundation-climate-biodiversity-initiative-call-for-projects/) for projects dedicated to the ocean and coastal ecosystems. Applicants can [submit their projects](https://climate-and-biodiversity-initiative.fondation.bnpparibas/en/) from 21 January to the 4th of May. The call is open to all scientific teams from Europe conducting research on subjects focusing on climate and biodiversity related to ocean and coastal ecosystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Planet launched their high-resolution Pelican-2 satellite and 36 SuperDoves of Flock 4G to orbit on SpaceX's Transporter-12 Rideshare mission](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-launches-high-resolution-pelican-2-satellite-36-superdoves/). Successful contact has been made, and the commissioning process has started. 

2. The use of spatial data can be transformative in the face of climate change, biodiversity loss, and development challenges, as it enables national governments, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples and local communities and researchers to make data-driven decisions to prioritise action and monitor progress towards their goals more accurately. To support these decisionmakers, [UN Biodiversity Lab](http://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/) was developed. It [provides](https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UNBL-brochure_English.pdf) historic and current spatial data on nature, ecosystem services, climate change and sustainable development; it helps developing easy-to-understand maps; provides automatic summaries of biodiversity trends and environmental change; and has clear source information and other metadata.

**News and updates about applications**
1. It is now possible to [show maps on a 3D globe](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2025/01/3d-globe-maps-using-a-javascript-sdk/) using MapTiler SDK with just one line of code. 

**Indices and indicators**
1. [Updated indicators demonstrate best practice for positive impacts on biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/capturing-the-positive-impacts-of-sustainable-land-use-investment-for-investors). Financial institutions are starting to realise the opportunities that investing in sustainable land use brings. In particular, impact investors are increasingly moving into this space, looking to add investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and ecosystem restoration to their portfolios. Such investments generate not only financial returns, but also have positive impacts on biodiversity, climate adaptation and mitigation, and local livelihoods. However, it is important that these impacts are measured and evidenced robustly, yet cost-effectively, and achieving this balance can be tricky. Therefore, the [Positive Impact Indicators Directory](https://landuseimpacthub.com/en/kpis) was developed by UNEP-WCMC and UNEP in 2019. This Directory contains a shortlist of indicators to help investors measure their positive impact across several areas: biodiversity, sustainable production, climate action and livelihoods. The [Directory was updated early 2025](https://kpi-directory.production.wordpress-linode.linode.unep-wcmc.org/content//uploads/2025/01/Guide-on-indicator-changes-Jan-2025.pdf): Forest indicators were merged into existing biodiversity and sustainable production indicators to ensure clarity in categorising and avoid duplication; ecosystem extent indicators were streamlined; indicators which relied on counterfactual calculations, which was not suitably robust, were removed; indicators capturing ecosystem condition and indicators for species presence were added; and significant flags were integrated in some of the indicators to align with best practices and to guide investors to take action where it matters most.  

2. A groundbreaking new study, '[Governance and resilience as entry points for transforming food systems in the countdown to 2030](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/78839aee-a0f2-4741-aade-67e526f962f6)', published in Nature Food, presents the [first comprehensive analysis of change since 2000 in key food system indicators](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-report-highlights-critical-food-system-trends-and-challenges-in-countdown-to-2030/en). This report shows that tradeoffs are inevitable between food systems goals such as jobs, climate, nutrition, food security and resilience. With stronger governance and better data, these tradeoffs can be mitigated and even flipped into synergies.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. This year marks the [20th anniversary of the Group on Earth Observations](https://earthobservations.org/news/celebrating-20-years-earth-intelligence-milestone-group-earth-observations) (GEO). One of GEO's enduring legacies is its commitment to open knowledge, and initiatives like the [GEO Knowledge Hub](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/) are turning data into actionable insights, integrating citizen science, Indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge technology to ensure equitable access to Earth intelligence. In May, the [GEO Global Forum](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025) will be held in Rome, where experts, policymakers and stakeholders from around the world will explore how Earth intelligence can address today's critical issues. 

2. Call for courses for FSCI 2025: from 21 - 25 July, 2025, FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI) 2025 [Working towards Open Scholarship in the age of intelligent automation](https://force11.org/fsci-2025/) will be held. Course proposals can be [submitted until the 24th of January](https://forms.gle/Xv66oRWZzYa1E6MVA). Courses will meet 3 - 5 times during the week of the meeting, and sessions are usually between 1 and 3 hours long. All courses will meet via Zoom.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDU0bye92_Y) (including a section on the monitoring assessment) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as_Rd5ZCJkY) session of Marine Life 2030: Advancing biology and ecosystem ocean observations and forecasting, which were organised by MBON, Marine Life 2030, GOOS and the AIR Centre. 

## Agenda for upcoming conferences, webinars and events
*22 January, 2025*, 14.00 - 15.00 CET, Webinar as part of the IPPN Knowledge Café: [How can integrated policies deliver the UN common approaches to biodiversity and pollution?](https://www.sparkblue.org/event/webinar-ippn-knowledge-cafe-how-can-integrated-policies-deliver-the-UN-common-approaches-to-biodiversity-and-pollution)

*29 January, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [introduction](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CewuDyZETdKYMJfSvyeSsQ) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). In this seminar, an introduction and overview of the Nexus and Transformative Change assessments is given, and how they are connected.

In this seminar, the focus will be on biodiversity as the first and most fundamental nexus element.

*10 - 11 March, 2025*, the third edition of the International Ocean Data Conference, online and in Santa Marta, Colombia: [The data we need for the ocean we want](https://oceandataconference.org/iodc-iii-programme)

*26 March, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [third seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_E89GSYmMT_2Wv0SPz8dptA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). A stable climate underpins the continued functioning of all other benefits across the nexus. While climate change mitigation or adaptation actions often have positive impacts on other parts of the nexus, some have potential negative impacts. This seminar will focus on how producing energy has impacts on all nexus elements, so transitioning to low carbon energy and energy demand management will be necessary.

*30 April, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fourth seminar: Food](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_r5RkHrUkSbmUL4p28JuL6g) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Access to food and to live free from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity is a fundamental human right. This seminar will focus on the response options considered ranging from production-based approaches to governance and dietary approaches.

*28 May, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fifth seminar: Water](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BH2xMZwaTyGjjiwGSoyv5w) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). This seminar will focus on the analysis of response options including consideration of interactions between freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems while also incorporating nature's contributions to people.

*25 June, 2025*, The sixth seminar: Health of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Health systems and health policies interact with other elements of the nexus and can strengthen the response to climate change, both on the mitigation and adaptation front. This seminar will focus on how poor outcomes for other nexus sectors translate to poor human health.
