### News and articles
**Biodiversity**
1. The 20th edition of the World Economic Forum's [Global Risks Report](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/) lands with a stark warning: the planet is in peril. Topping the 10-year risk rankings are extreme weather events, the relentless loss of biodiversity, collapsing ecosystems and critical shifts in Earth's systems - threats that demand urgent attention. The [unravelling of Earth's ecosystems is perhaps the most insidious threat, yet it is often lost in translation](https://earthobservations.org/news/flying-blind-how-disrupting-ecosystems-puts-everything-risk). To understand the danger, think of Earth's ecosystems as a Boeing 747 aircraft - a complex and beautiful piece of engineering with 6 million parts, all working together to keep it in the air. On a 747, every part, every screw, has a defined role - a role which only it can do to help keep the plane in the air. Sure, you might still be able to fly if you take out just one screw, but there will be consequences. It's the same with ecosystems. Every species is optimally fitted for a specific function - if you remove one species, something else must then do that job, normally at a far lower efficiency. Removing or damaging parts puts increased stress on other parts of the system. Damage can cascade rapidly, driving an ecosystem to the brink of collapse - like a vibrant coral reef teeming with life deteriorating into an algae-covered grave.

2. The European Union (EU) awarded the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) EUR 27 million to [tackle organised crime networks trafficking in wildlife globally and reduce the demand driving this illicit trade](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-european-union-guard-wildlife-initiative-2025), in collaboration with civil society organizations. The new initiative, GUARD Wildlife - Global United Action to Reduce and Dismantle Organized Wildlife Crime - aims to conserve endangered species and biodiversity for future generations. GUARD Wildlife will enhance coordinated responses to combat wildlife crime at the national, regional and international levels and reduce illicit trafficking in wildlife and wildlife products in source, transit and destination countries. The initiative will unite key players to improve collaboration and strengthen information sharing. Efforts will also focus on bolstering national enforcement systems, including customs, police and border control, by providing expert mentorship and targeted support. Additionally, innovative demand-reduction efforts grounded in behavioural science will be implemented in consumer markets.

3. Operation Thunder 2024, which was held from the 11th of November to the 6th of December, brought police, customs, border control, forestry and wildlife officials from 138 countries and regions, together, marking the widest participation since the first edition in 2017, and resulted in the [seizing of nearly 20,000 live animals, all endangered or protected species](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/iccwc-operation-thunder-2024). 365 suspects were arrested, and 6 transnational criminal networks suspected of trafficking animals and plants protected by CITES were identified. The live animals, which included big cats, birds, pangolins, primates and reptiles were rescued in connection with 2,213 seizures made worldwide. Where possible, wildlife forensic experts collected DNA samples before transferring the animals to conservation centres, where their health was assessed while awaiting repatriation or rehabilitation, in line with national frameworks and relevant protocols. The collection of DNA is a crucial part of supporting prosecutions, as it helps confirm the type of species and its origin or distribution, shedding light on new trafficking routes and emerging trends. In addition to the live animals, participating countries seized hundreds of thousands of protected animal parts and derivatives, trees, plants, marine life and arthropods. More than 100 companies involved in the trafficking of protected species were also identified.

4. [Call for nominations for the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award is open](https://www.gbif.org/news/4AAE2KOKBRJ0iS2DE2fT65/call-for-nominations-opens-for-2025-gbif-graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to highlight innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master's and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data. The 2025 programme will provide two €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers. Candidates receive formal nominations from the node managers and heads of delegation from GBIF Participant countries, who generally select one master's and one PhD candidate whose nominations are then forwarded to the GBIF Secretariat. Candidates must be either a citizen of a country participating in GBIF or a student at an institution located in a GBIF participant country. National node managers and/or heads of delegation may submit 2 nominees per country by the 27th of June 2025. The country deadlines vary, the earliest known deadline is the 24th of May in Mexico and South Africa.

5. World Wetlands Day was held on the 2nd of February, with the theme '[Protecting wetlands for our common future](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2740)', to remind us of the benefits wetlands provide for biodiversity and human wellbeing: wetlands help us cope with the impacts of climate change and secure critical freshwater resources. Wetlands are protected under many conservation instruments, many have been recognised not only as Ramsar sites, but also as UNESCO World Heritage properties and Biosphere Reserves, yet they are among the planet's most threatened ecosystems. 

6. Cocoa production has been linked to high rates of deforestation and biodiversity loss, making it a significant contributor to environmental degradation. Addressing and mitigating these negative impacts is essential for [achieving a more sustainable cocoa supply chain](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/users-in-action/ecom-reducing-deforestation-cocoa-supply-chain/). ECOM, one of the world's largest cocoa traders and processors that sources from over 30 countries, has made it a priority to reduce the negative impacts from their operations. One way to do that is by applying a standardised [methodology](https://www.wri.org/research/mapping-cocoa-assessing-deforestation-risk-cocoa-cote-divoire-ghana) developed by the World Resources Institute to ensure the cocoa beans they use are sustainably sourced and are not linked to forest loss. ECOM adapted its methodology to carry out widespread risk assessment in a standardised manner, expanding the model to other geographies and analysing data from Cameroon, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, Mexico, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Vietnam and Uganda. Once high-risk areas have been identified, ECOM works with smallholder farmers to proactively tackle cocoa-linked deforestation, focusing on prevention through strategies like sensitization training or Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs. The focus on high-risk locations enables further engagement with farmers and remediation to avoid excluding them from the supply chain, which can lead to worse outcomes and accelerate deforestation.

**Climate**
1. The [Egyptian Carbon Center has been named an Accelerator for the Race to Zero](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/egyptian-carbon-center-appointed-accelerator-for-the-race-to-zero/), a key role that highlights its leadership in carbon management and sustainability. This partnership aims to accelerate the decarbonization efforts of companies worldwide, providing them with essential tools and guidance to achieve net zero emissions. As an Accelerator, the Egyptian Carbon Center will offer companies access to cutting-edge resources and tailored strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. This collaboration supports businesses in setting ambitious climate goals, implementing effective decarbonization practices, and fostering long-term environmental and economic benefits. Partnering with the Egyptian Carbon Center will help companies drive innovation and enhance competitiveness by adopting green technologies.

2. It is widely acknowledged that the world needs to move away from its dependence on fossil fuels. However, the shift to renewable sources is not without its own environmental and social impacts. Experts at UNEP-WCMC have co-authored a [new working paper](https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/critical-transitions-circularity-equity-and-responsibility-quest-energy) that examines the potential costs of the green energy transition. The need for an energy transition is clear, and is reflected in the rapid growth of renewable energy industries in recent years (between 2011 and 2023, renewable energy production capacity increased five-fold). However, [moving from fossil fuels to these alternative sources is not straightforward](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/the-green-energy-transition-and-mining); it requires a vast amount of natural resources in order to build and develop the infrastructure. Furthermore, there is a risk of exacerbating existing inequalities: with nearly three-quarters of the world's population currently lacking access to electricity, we must ensure that people are not left behind. As the working paper points out, there are significant hurdles to overcome to meet the unprecedented demand for critical minerals. Distribution of these resources is concentrated in specific regions around the world, and so supply can be vulnerable to trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, it takes around 16 years on average to fully establish a new mining operation, and this can be much longer as a result of the unpredictable factors outlined above. Another issue is quality: as many of the world's easily accessible mineral deposits have already been mined, average grades of minerals (that is, the amount of metal within the ore body) are declining. This means that more rock needs to be mined to produce the same amount of metal, which in turn means more energy is used. Beyond these supply issues, there are pressing concerns about the wider environmental and social impacts of mining processes. Some of these are direct and obvious. For example, clearing land for extraction and processing operations destroys wildlife habitats and displaces local communities. Similarly, the chemicals used in processing create air and water pollution which can harm the health of both animal and human populations.

**Oceans**
1. Argo, the global network of autonomous floats that revolutionized ocean observation, marked its 25th anniversary in December. Since its inception, Argos has grown into a fleet of nearly 4,000 robotic floats, drifting with ocean currents and conducting dives of up to 6,000 meters. These floats collect critical data that contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), allowing us to [better understand changes in ocean heat, sea level rise, and circulation, improve weather and extreme event forecasts, and help society manage and adapt to climate change](https://goosocean.org/news/celebrating-25-years-of-argo-a-pillar-of-the-global-ocean-observing-system/). 

2. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps, a [reliable marine biodiversity foresight solution](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/23/species-distribution-maps/), is an important tool for Ocean protection. Using cutting-edge model-based capacities, the [OBIS Species Distribution Maps](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/) allows marine planners and decision-makers to identify, better manage and protect the biodiversity-rich areas of tomorrow's Ocean. Developed as a key component of the ambitious EU-funded MPA Europe project, the OBIS Species Distribution Map brings many advances, such as the integration of the five latest IPCC climate change scenarios, at an unparalleled resolution. As a marine biodiversity foresight solution, the OBIS Species Distribution Map fully supports crucial global biodiversity objectives such as achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework “30x30” target. The OBIS Species Distribution Maps are at the heart of the MPA Europe project's innovative approach. The project integrates blue carbon storage estimations, ocean connectivity, climate velocity, and marine biodiversity predictions into a prioritization tool, providing a holistic vision that supports decision-makers in implementing future Marine Protected Areas. This holistic approach translated into a challenging requirement for the OBIS team to match the project's ambitions.

3. Over the past year, data from the Copernicus Marine Service has been at the forefront of a [collaboration between Ocean Energy Europe and Mercator Ocean International](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/data-innovation-copernicus-marine-and-ocean-energy). This collaboration has showcased the impactful role Copernicus Marine has played in advancing the ocean energy sector. The collaboration aimed to bridge the gap between data providers and the industry by highlighting the practical applications of free, high-resolution ocean data in renewable energy development. By providing detailed information on ocean conditions such as currents, wave height, and salinity, this service supports decision-making at every stage of project development - from site selection to operations and maintenance. A key milestone of the collaboration was the identification and promotion of five use cases: 1. [CorPower Ocean: identifying global wave energy potential & projecting future energy systems](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/identifying-global-wave-energy-potential), 2. [Mocean Energy: optimising wave energy: Copernicus Marine Data for site selection and performance](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/optimising-wave-energy), 3. [MESPAC: Innovative solutions for offshore energy: MESPAC's AI-powered data enhancement](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/offshore-energy-mespacs-ai-powered-data), 4. [IMDC: the iMED model supporting Ocean Energy in the Mediterranean](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/supporting-Ocean-Energy-in-Mediterranean), and 5. [Minesto: harnessing predictable tidal energy in the Faroe Islands](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services/use-cases/harnessing-predictable-tidal-energy-faroe-islands). 

4. [The Copernicus Marine Service 2 (2021 - 2028) will start the second phase of its operations from 2025 to 2028, building on the success of Phase 1](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-2-enters-its-second-phase). The Copernicus Marine Service has expanded rapidly with a significant rise in user uptake. Phase 1 of Copernicus 2 (2021-2024) saw more than 88,000 users register for the service, growing by 30% on an annual basis. Similarly, the Copernicus Marine website attracts 1.5 million individual visitors each year, a 52% rise in unique visitors since 2023. The second phase of the Copernicus Marine Service 2 will focus on improving the service to maintain and reinforce its position as a world-leading marine monitoring service. Evolutions of Thematic Assembly Centres and Monitoring Forecasting Centres products will include the integration of new satellite missions (e.g. SWOT) and in situ observations, better processing techniques, models, coupling and data assimilation and an increasing use of Artificial Intelligence.

5. The Copernicus Marine Service is committed to continuously improving the quality and fitness-for-purpose of the design of its products and services. In line with these efforts, twelve downstream services have been [launched](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-service-launches-new-projects-improve-coastal-monitoring-and-support-eu) as pilot demonstrations for EU Coastal Monitoring activities. The 12 funded projects are expected to deliver significant value to users, strengthen collaboration with national marine and coastal initiatives, and showcase the practical applications and benefits of Copernicus Marine data. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. Freshwaters are some of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet, and insufficient data availability contributes to challenges in conserving these essential environments. To support freshwater data holders, GBIF has [released](https://www.gbif.org/news/m6FopQ34VB8Bxcw2stU1T/new-guide-released-to-support-freshwater-data-publishing) the [Freshwater Data Publishing Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-sw3k-w725) to better support data-intensive research, policy, and management of these environments. This guide is part of a [series of digital documentation guides](https://www.gbif.org/training#_gbif-digital-guides) currently open for community peer review.

**News and updates about applications**
1. The latest update of the Copernicus Marine [MyOcean Pro Viewer](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/myocean-viewer), v.13, an interactive online tool that allows users to visualise and download Copernicus Marine data, has been [released](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/myocean-pro-viewer-update-situ-data-and-streamline-visualisation). It provides an intuitive interface to explore a wide range of oceanographic datasets, including satellite observations, numerical models, and in situ measurements. With this update, the MyOcean Pro Viewer now enables users to explore in situ observations collected from a series of geo-referenced platforms, such as floats, drifters, and gliders. When selecting an in situ platform, users can now access detailed information, along with time series or profile graphs. Moreover, the Viewer now allows users to combine graphs from different platforms into a single interface. This streamlined capability makes it easy to compare measurements such as temperature, salinity, and currents across various locations. These features make the access to in situ data, which are essential for understanding regional ocean dynamics, easier, more intuitive, and suitable for a wide range of user needs.

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. The [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt) (EJT) — a leading electronic open-access journal for taxonomic research — has become the first scientific journal to [launch](https://www.gbif.org/news/2JHV6IsWcUUrD57I3FgXIQ/european-journal-of-taxonomy-launches-gbif-hosted-portal) a [GBIF hosted portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/), paving the way for other academic publishers to participate in the programme. This marks a move to elevate the access, reuse and interoperability of [material citations](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/a064f300-1bc8-41ea-9364-b864ef4e8938), traditionally confined within PDFs, that are now disseminated through published datasets. Users can explore features such as [data clustering](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/occurrence/search/?view=CLUSTERS) which enables discovery of potentially related occurrences by identifying related type specimens and linkages between records from different sources. This feature in combination with powerful [search tools](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/occurrence/search/) and [dashboard visualization](https://ejt.hp.gbif.org/dashboard/) extends the reach of occurrences in GBIF to taxonomic treatments and publications through the [EJT portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/).

2. [FAIRsharing and FIPs (FAIR implementation profiles): where we are, where we are headed](https://blog.fairsharing.org/?p=971). At the core of putting FAIR in practice are the choices that have to be made when selecting the appropriate standards (i.e., terminologies, models, formats, minimal information requirements, and identifier schema) and databases (repositories and knowledge bases). These resources are essential to describe, report and identify, as well as share research objects (e.g., datasets, code, workflows). Often each project, group or organisation (i.e., community) has its own norms. To map this landscape, the concept of the FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) was created in 2019 together with ENVRI-FAIR and developed in a series of projects guided by the GO FAIR Foundation, to represent a collection of declarations a community makes about the usage of FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), including standards, services and policies. Across all disciplines, however, there are thousands of standards, databases and policies, which are core FERs; and this is where [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) comes in. An informative and educational service on standards, inter-related to databases and data policies, across all disciplines, FAIRsharing guides consumers and producers to discover, select and use these resources with confidence, producers to make their resource more discoverable, more widely adopted and cited. The description of these resources are curated and tagged according to the maturity (i.e., ready, in development, deprecated, uncertain) to reflect their very dynamic evolution. [FIP Wizard](https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org/) is specialised for the creation of FIPs, and provides templates organised as questionnaires. The integration of the FIP Wizard with FAIRsharing makes use of its rich content.

3. Ecological monitoring data, whether gathered through traditional on-the-ground surveys or emerging approaches around sensor networks, forms the gold standard for understanding biodiversity on a changing planet. However, the lack of a standardized way of collecting such essential information about methods has limited its reuse, leaving researchers and practitioners unable to leverage the power of survey datasets to monitor changing biodiversity trends. [Survey and Monitoring Data Quick-Start Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-7t3p-ve38): A how-to for updating a Darwin Core dataset using the Humboldt Extension takes a [key step toward closing this gap](https://www.gbif.org/news/17fTMFas4AhM3tvzPvp882/enhancing-discovery-and-reuse-of-survey-and-monitoring-data-with-new-guide). The standardized vocabulary of 55 new terms that Humboldt introduces allows data publishers to capture consistent contextual information about survey and monitoring activities and maximize the reusability of the resulting records.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. Beds of iceplant, dotted with daisy-like flowers, carpet the roadside and bluffs of coastal California. Although they look beautiful, this familiar plant is an invader: it chokes out native plants and salts the earth beneath it, it prevents sand from moving on the wind to replenish beaches and dunes. NCEAS researchers are collaborating with NASA and The Nature Conservatory to develop a comprehensive map of iceplant. To eradicate invasive species, land managers need to know where it grows. With NASA's support, the project will use [deep learning to combine satellite, airplane and drone images into a single comprehensive map](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/mapping-invader). The Nature Conservatory has begun treating the first 300 acres of iceplant (from an estimated 1,000 acres across the Dangermond Preserve in California), as as the project progresses, ongoing mapping will guide to where iceplant might hide among native vegetation or where it may have resurged.

2. In three months, from the 5th to the 9th of May, [Rome will welcome Earth observations experts, academics, industry leaders and policymakers](https://earthobservations.org/news/rome-gears-geo-global-forum-2025-where-global-leaders-will-shape-future-earth-intelligence) from around the world for the [GEO Global Forum 2025](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025). Data-driven solutions have the power to change how we understand and care for the planet: helping farmers adopt more efficient and sustainable practices, communities adapt to the climate crisis and businesses innovate. But to truly unlock this potential, we must turn data into action with solutions that pair advanced technology with human empathy, ethics and experience,because technology alone won't solve the climate and nature crisis, according to Yana Gevorgyan, Director of the GEO Secretariat. A high-level ministerial meeting will bring leaders together to agree on practical steps for using Earth Intelligence to achieve net-zero and nature-positive goals, build resilience to extreme heat and deliver early warnings for all. The Plenary will also include a pledging event to secure political and financial commitments for the implementation of GEO’s Post-2025 Strategy. Additionally, youth leaders will take centre stage, highlighting GEO’s ongoing commitment to intergenerational collaboration.

3. IMB, C40 Cities and the Group of Earth Observations announced a new collaboration aimed at scaling up social innovation action in cities around the world. In alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the new project will develop [artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to advance city resiliency and address specific challenges facing urban communities](https://earthobservations.org/news/ibm-c40-cities-and-group-earth-observations-collaborate-new-ai-project-resilient-cities). With support from the Group on Earth Observations , IBM and C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities, will work together to create a data-driven, AI-powered solution to help cities analyze potential risks that may arise as a result of extreme heat and the urban heat island effect. These can include stressed energy resources, increases in mortality rates, and socioeconomic disparities. The new solution will aim to enable cities to create adaptation strategies to help alleviate population health risks and economic burdens, while strengthening national resilience efforts.

4. Agriculture, forestry, and land use emissions have a notable influence on global climate change, contributing 26% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In response, environmental policies increasingly require sustainable agricultural practices like [carbon farming, which maximize carbon sequestration](https://www.planet.com/pulse/a-guide-to-carbon-farming-and-what-it-means-for-global-sustainability-efforts/). But confirming compliance with evolving mandates can be challenging. Manual data collection is costly and time consuming, making it difficult to scale operations to meet new requirements. With high-frequency satellite data and analytics, agencies can detect and monitor agricultural activity, at scale. Let's explore how this practice, known as broad area management, helps stakeholders quantify change within agricultural parcels, verify compliance, and work towards emission reduction targets. Carbon farming, also known as regenerative agriculture, aims to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil, by maximizing plant growth and minimizing soil disturbance. When plants die, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is either released back into the atmosphere or stored for long periods of time in the soil. Many conventional agriculture practices, such as tilling, result in the release of carbon. However, practices classified under carbon farming aim to do the opposite, by putting carbon back into the soil and keeping it there: no-till farming: avoiding plowing and tilling to minimise soil disturbance and erosion; crop rotation and intercropping: diversifying crops to improve soil health; planting cover crops: growing crops to cover the soil rather than for harvesting; and agroforestry: integrating trees and shrubs into crop fields to improve soil structure and keep carbon in the ground.

5. [Tutorial using Google Earth Engine with GBIF mediated occurrences](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/2025-01-23-time-series-of-land-surface-temperature/): exploring how to integrate remote sensing data with biodiversity observations to analyse the relationships between environmental factors and species occurrence, following an example of analysing the Land Surface Temperature over time and its relationship to observations of the songbird the Northern Cardinal. 

6. Since 2016, over 3,600 scientific publications using Planet data have been published, showcasing Planet data's widespread impact across a variety of disciplines in both industry and academia. The constant stream of new research makes digesting these insights a significant challenge—just last year, two new manuscripts were published every day. To help synthesize the vast amounts of published research, a large language model (LLM) was used to [explore whether cutting-edge AI technologies can assist in extracting insights on Planet data usage and applications](https://www.planet.com/pulse/ai-enabled-insights-from-publications-leveraging-planet-data/) from our growing publication database. With a focus on identifying the contexts (e.g., agriculture, forestry, environmental monitoring) in which the data is applied, the most frequently used data products, and the geographies of both the study authors and their study regions. As researchers drive new discoveries with Planet data and share through scientific publications, we expect AI tools to accelerate insights and enhance collaboration across disciplines. The model correctly extracted answers for most of the questions and manuscripts, with 90% accuracy for most of the manuscripts, the highest error rate (4.2%) occurred when identifying the type of product used (e.g., PlanetScope Imagery, Basemaps, Fusion). This challenge arises because authors may refer to Planet Basemaps simply as 'Planet Imagery' or use different terms for PlanetScope Imagery, such as 'Dove Imagery', 'CubeSats Imagery', or 'SuperDove Imagery'.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**

1. [Highlighting the worldviews and voices of African Indigenous Peoples at the BES-Net Regional Trialogue for West and Central Africa](https://www.besnet.world/highlighting-the-worldviews-and-voices-of-african-indigenous-peoples-at-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-west-and-central-africa/). The Trialogue was structured around specific and multi-stakeholder objectives: contextualizing knowledge, addressing issues related to invasive alien species and the sustainable use of wild species to enhance food security and human well-being, analysing the challenges of implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The central question of the meeting was: "How can we reconcile this very specific scale of local terrain with the scale of national policy - as well as for the UN on a global scale - in order to ensure the stability of the planet and our ability to manage ecosystems well, while taking into account the different realities experienced in relationships with nature?"

2. New [WWF-led research](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-led-research-highlights-invisible-wildlife-benefits-people-receive-but-could-lose-if-biodiversity-crisis-ignored), which has been [published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44358-024-00006-9), reveals that the vital benefits wildlife provides to people's everyday lives are vastly underrepresented across science and policy discussions. This oversight could have detrimental consequences for achieving global conservation targets. The concept of Nature's Contributions to People is well-established in science, business and policy, and it is often assumed that protecting a habitat or ecosystem will automatically preserve the benefits people rely on. Out of 18 NCP categories, as defined by IPBES, the study found that at least 12 are directly supported by wildlife, ranging from material benefits, such as food and livelihoods from fish or game species, to non-material values including ecotourism, medicinal uses, and a sense of identity or well-being. Long-term loss of wildlife will lead to declines in its contributions to people and ultimately harm people's wellbeing. A well-known example is the case of the North American sea otters. The 19th century fur trade led to a loss of the otter populations, after which an explosion in sea urchins destroyed kelp forests. This had severe consequences for fish populations, local fishing communities, and coastal ecosystems, making the area more vulnerable to storms and erosion and reducing the resources available to Indigenous communities that relied on kelp.

3. IUCN Save Our Species and the International Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme supported [vital projects that supported local communities, and protected threatened species as well as their habitats](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2024-our-year-in-review/), translating global goals into concrete action to support community conservation action. Some of the highlights of 2024 include: 2 calls for proposals: the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund with a focus on threatened ungulates, and SOS Lemurs; the SOS African Wildlife Initiative lessons learned workshop on achievements, shared lessons and explored strategies for human-wildlife conflict mitigation, biodiversity monitoring and community engagement; 2 reports, the [Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme on 10 years of tiger conservation](https://iucnsos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IUCN-ITHCP-150pdi-Spreads-DIGITAL.pdf) and an [impact report on the SOS African Wildlife initiative's rapid action grants](https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/iucn-celebrates-10-impactful-years-tiger-conservation-new-report) which showed that the €3.8 million investment across 23 African countries resulted in the protection of 58 threatened species.

4. New [natural forest data on Global Forest Watch](https://gfw.global/4fQfl03) from the [Science Based Target Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/) Natural Lands Map can help shed light on where the world's natural forests are located and provide a baseline for monitoring loss within them since 2020. The map, developed through a collaboration of Land & Carbon Lab, WWF and Systemiq, supports companies who have committed to eliminate conversion of natural lands in their supply chains through targets set with the SBTN land sector framework.

**Climate**
1. The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2024 annual global climate report](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202413); 2024 is officially the planet's [warmest year on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record). The 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. Additionally, the Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to its second-lowest extent on record, as well as the upper ocean heat content, the amount of heat stored in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, was the highest on record. Ocean heat content is a key climate indicator because the ocean stores 90% of the excess heat in the Earth system, and the five highest values have all occurred in the last five years.

2. [Wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area since the 7th of January](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained), displacing tens of thousands of people and destroying large areas. While California is no stranger to summer wildfires (typically starting in June and continuing through October when the weather is hot and dry), this January outbreak is an outlier, fueled by unusually severe fire weather conditions across the state's southern region. During most years, no fire alerts are detected in Los Angeles in the first three months of the year. Only in 2021, one of the most devastating years regarding wildfires in California, more than 10 fire alerts had been detected between January and March. In 2025, over 170 fire alerts had been detected by the 13th of January. 

3. The United Kingdom Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is leading a [significant 5-year research initiative](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/international-science-net-zero-plus), focussing on the effects of climate change on air and water quality, land use, and estimating the potential for greenhouse gas removal. To expand the accessibility of the program's digital outputs beyond academic papers and reports, UKCEH has chosen the [online platform MapX for wider dissemination](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/adsfoiuv9). 

**Oceans**
1. The [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network is playing a crucial role in understanding and protecting the vital ecosystem of the Northern California Current](https://marinebon.org/the-marine-biodiversity-network-keeps-an-eye-on-the-california-current/). Researchers and agencies are being brought together, and MBON is facilitating collaboration and data sharing, enabling scientists to study the current dynamics more effectively. As the current delivers cool water from the north (British Columbia), wind driven upwelling brings colder, nutrient-rich water from the ocean depths up to the surface. Those nutrients give a boost to marine phytoplankton that feed whales, seals, seabirds and other wildlife, as well as the iconic seafood of the Oregon coast and the fishing communities that depend on them. Understanding the past and present of the current, will enable everyone depending on it to be as ready as possible for an uncertain future.

2. A new study, [published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4541-3), has found that ocean warming in 2024 has led to [new record high temperatures](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sea-surface-and-deeper-water-temperatures-reached-new-record-high-2024) and discusses how a hotter ocean affects our lives on land and what this means for our future. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 meters ocean heat content increased by 16 zettajoules, which was approximately 40 times the world's total electricity generation in 2023. Ocean heat is the best measurement to monitor climate change. Increasing ocean heat content affects marine ecosystems, currents, sea ice, the way water separates into layers, climate variation and evolution, global weather systems, ocean-atmosphere interactions, sea level, the ocean's carbon cycle, oxygen levels, and human livelihoods. 

3. The Copernicus Marine Service [announced](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-release-copernicus-marine-toolbox) the latest major release of the [Copernicus Marine Toolbox](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/collections/9080063-copernicus-marine-toolbox), bringing a host of enhancements, such as a greater flexibility for integrating with diverse workflows, from high-performance computing systems to lightweight solutions like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.

4. International networks, citizen science initiatives, research institutes, universities and NGOs [working on marine biodiversity data are invited to participate in the DTO Bioflow second open call for marine biodiversity (monitoring) data](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/17/eudto-2ndcall/). These calls invite institutions to contribute to the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO) by making their data available through EMODnet Biology, a portal providing open, free access to interoperable data on the temporal and spatial distribution of marine species (e.g., angiosperms, benthos, birds, fish, macroalgae, mammals, reptiles, phyto- and zooplankton) from European regional seas. EMODnet runs the European OBIS node, so data in EMODnet also flows to the global OBIS data platform. Selected participants will receive funding of up to €60,000 per institution to support integrating their data into the EU DTO. The [submission deadline is the 28th of February 2025](https://dto-bioflow.eu/second-open-call-marine-biodiversity-data).

5. As the Ocean Decade enters its midpoint, [a new batch of 39 Decade Actions is setting the stage for transformative ocean solutions](https://oceandecade.org/news/wave-of-new-ocean-decade-actions-launch-the-year-ahead/), driving ocean sustainability worldwide. The new initiatives address ocean pollution, coastal resilience, hands-on citizen science, and a sustainable ocean economy. 

6. At the end of 2024, [51 IOI Ocean Academy courses have been delivered](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-ioi-ocean-academy-another-successful-year-of-outreach-and-global-growth-with-51-ioi-ocean-academy-courses-successfully-delivered-in-16-languages/) globally by the IOI Ocean Academy Directors. The programmes were offered in 16 local languages and dialects: Arabic, Dhivehi, English, French, Georgian, Hindi, Kiswahili, Marathi, Portuguese, Sinhala, Spanish, Thai, Tunesian Dialect, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu.  

7. The BNP Paribas Foundation [launches a new 'climate and biodiversity initiative' call](https://oceandecade.org/news/bnp-paribas-foundation-climate-biodiversity-initiative-call-for-projects/) for projects dedicated to the ocean and coastal ecosystems. Applicants can [submit their projects](https://climate-and-biodiversity-initiative.fondation.bnpparibas/en/) from 21 January to the 4th of May. The call is open to all scientific teams from Europe conducting research on subjects focusing on climate and biodiversity related to ocean and coastal ecosystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Planet launched their high-resolution Pelican-2 satellite and 36 SuperDoves of Flock 4G to orbit on SpaceX's Transporter-12 Rideshare mission](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-launches-high-resolution-pelican-2-satellite-36-superdoves/). Successful contact has been made, and the commissioning process has started. 

2. The use of spatial data can be transformative in the face of climate change, biodiversity loss, and development challenges, as it enables national governments, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples and local communities and researchers to make data-driven decisions to prioritise action and monitor progress towards their goals more accurately. To support these decisionmakers, [UN Biodiversity Lab](http://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/) was developed. It [provides](https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UNBL-brochure_English.pdf) historic and current spatial data on nature, ecosystem services, climate change and sustainable development; it helps developing easy-to-understand maps; provides automatic summaries of biodiversity trends and environmental change; and has clear source information and other metadata.

**News and updates about applications**
1. It is now possible to [show maps on a 3D globe](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2025/01/3d-globe-maps-using-a-javascript-sdk/) using MapTiler SDK with just one line of code. 

**Indices and indicators**
1. [Updated indicators demonstrate best practice for positive impacts on biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/capturing-the-positive-impacts-of-sustainable-land-use-investment-for-investors). Financial institutions are starting to realise the opportunities that investing in sustainable land use brings. In particular, impact investors are increasingly moving into this space, looking to add investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and ecosystem restoration to their portfolios. Such investments generate not only financial returns, but also have positive impacts on biodiversity, climate adaptation and mitigation, and local livelihoods. However, it is important that these impacts are measured and evidenced robustly, yet cost-effectively, and achieving this balance can be tricky. Therefore, the [Positive Impact Indicators Directory](https://landuseimpacthub.com/en/kpis) was developed by UNEP-WCMC and UNEP in 2019. This Directory contains a shortlist of indicators to help investors measure their positive impact across several areas: biodiversity, sustainable production, climate action and livelihoods. The [Directory was updated early 2025](https://kpi-directory.production.wordpress-linode.linode.unep-wcmc.org/content//uploads/2025/01/Guide-on-indicator-changes-Jan-2025.pdf): Forest indicators were merged into existing biodiversity and sustainable production indicators to ensure clarity in categorising and avoid duplication; ecosystem extent indicators were streamlined; indicators which relied on counterfactual calculations, which was not suitably robust, were removed; indicators capturing ecosystem condition and indicators for species presence were added; and significant flags were integrated in some of the indicators to align with best practices and to guide investors to take action where it matters most.  

2. A groundbreaking new study, '[Governance and resilience as entry points for transforming food systems in the countdown to 2030](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/78839aee-a0f2-4741-aade-67e526f962f6)', published in Nature Food, presents the [first comprehensive analysis of change since 2000 in key food system indicators](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-report-highlights-critical-food-system-trends-and-challenges-in-countdown-to-2030/en). This report shows that tradeoffs are inevitable between food systems goals such as jobs, climate, nutrition, food security and resilience. With stronger governance and better data, these tradeoffs can be mitigated and even flipped into synergies.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. This year marks the [20th anniversary of the Group on Earth Observations](https://earthobservations.org/news/celebrating-20-years-earth-intelligence-milestone-group-earth-observations) (GEO). One of GEO's enduring legacies is its commitment to open knowledge, and initiatives like the [GEO Knowledge Hub](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/) are turning data into actionable insights, integrating citizen science, Indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge technology to ensure equitable access to Earth intelligence. In May, the [GEO Global Forum](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025) will be held in Rome, where experts, policymakers and stakeholders from around the world will explore how Earth intelligence can address today's critical issues. 

2. Call for courses for FSCI 2025: from 21 - 25 July, 2025, FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI) 2025 [Working towards Open Scholarship in the age of intelligent automation](https://force11.org/fsci-2025/) will be held. Course proposals can be [submitted until the 24th of January](https://forms.gle/Xv66oRWZzYa1E6MVA). Courses will meet 3 - 5 times during the week of the meeting, and sessions are usually between 1 and 3 hours long. All courses will meet via Zoom.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDU0bye92_Y) (including a section on the monitoring assessment) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as_Rd5ZCJkY) session of Marine Life 2030: Advancing biology and ecosystem ocean observations and forecasting, which were organised by MBON, Marine Life 2030, GOOS and the AIR Centre. 

## Agenda for upcoming conferences, webinars and events

In this seminar, the focus will be on biodiversity as the first and most fundamental nexus element.

*10 - 11 March, 2025*, the third edition of the International Ocean Data Conference, online and in Santa Marta, Colombia: [The data we need for the ocean we want](https://oceandataconference.org/iodc-iii-programme)

*26 March, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [third seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_E89GSYmMT_2Wv0SPz8dptA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). A stable climate underpins the continued functioning of all other benefits across the nexus. While climate change mitigation or adaptation actions often have positive impacts on other parts of the nexus, some have potential negative impacts. This seminar will focus on how producing energy has impacts on all nexus elements, so transitioning to low carbon energy and energy demand management will be necessary.

*30 April, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fourth seminar: Food](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_r5RkHrUkSbmUL4p28JuL6g) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Access to food and to live free from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity is a fundamental human right. This seminar will focus on the response options considered ranging from production-based approaches to governance and dietary approaches.

*28 May, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fifth seminar: Water](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BH2xMZwaTyGjjiwGSoyv5w) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717).
