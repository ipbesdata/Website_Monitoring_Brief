**Biodiversity**
1. [Highlighting the worldviews and voices of African Indigenous Peoples at the BES-Net Regional Trialogue for West and Central Africa](https://www.besnet.world/highlighting-the-worldviews-and-voices-of-african-indigenous-peoples-at-the-bes-net-regional-trialogue-for-west-and-central-africa/). The Trialogue was structured around specific and multi-stakeholder objectives: contextualizing knowledge, addressing issues related to invasive alien species and the sustainable use of wild species to enhance food security and human well-being, analysing the challenges of implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The central question of the meeting was: "How can we reconcile this very specific scale of local terrain with the scale of national policy - as well as for the UN on a global scale - in order to ensure the stability of the planet and our ability to manage ecosystems well, while taking into account the different realities experienced in relationships with nature?"

2. New [WWF-led research](https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-led-research-highlights-invisible-wildlife-benefits-people-receive-but-could-lose-if-biodiversity-crisis-ignored), which has been [published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44358-024-00006-9), reveals that the vital benefits wildlife provides to people's everyday lives are vastly underrepresented across science and policy discussions. This oversight could have detrimental consequences for achieving global conservation targets. The concept of Nature's Contributions to People is well-established in science, business and policy, and it is often assumed that protecting a habitat or ecosystem will automatically preserve the benefits people rely on. Out of 18 NCP categories, as defined by IPBES, the study found that at least 12 are directly supported by wildlife, ranging from material benefits, such as food and livelihoods from fish or game species, to non-material values including ecotourism, medicinal uses, and a sense of identity or well-being. Long-term loss of wildlife will lead to declines in its contributions to people and ultimately harm people's wellbeing. A well-known example is the case of the North American sea otters. The 19th century fur trade led to a loss of the otter populations, after which an explosion in sea urchins destroyed kelp forests. This had severe consequences for fish populations, local fishing communities, and coastal ecosystems, making the area more vulnerable to storms and erosion and reducing the resources available to Indigenous communities that relied on kelp.

3. IUCN Save Our Species and the International Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme supported [vital projects that supported local communities, and protected threatened species as well as their habitats](https://iucnsos.org/looking-back-at-2024-our-year-in-review/), translating global goals into concrete action to support community conservation action. Some of the highlights of 2024 include: 2 calls for proposals: the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund with a focus on threatened ungulates, and SOS Lemurs; the SOS African Wildlife Initiative lessons learned workshop on achievements, shared lessons and explored strategies for human-wildlife conflict mitigation, biodiversity monitoring and community engagement; 2 reports, the [Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme on 10 years of tiger conservation](https://iucnsos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IUCN-ITHCP-150pdi-Spreads-DIGITAL.pdf) and an [impact report on the SOS African Wildlife initiative's rapid action grants](https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/iucn-celebrates-10-impactful-years-tiger-conservation-new-report) which showed that the €3.8 million investment across 23 African countries resulted in the protection of 58 threatened species.

4. New [natural forest data on Global Forest Watch](https://gfw.global/4fQfl03) from the [Science Based Target Network](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/) Natural Lands Map can help shed light on where the world's natural forests are located and provide a baseline for monitoring loss within them since 2020. The map, developed through a collaboration of Land & Carbon Lab, WWF and Systemiq, supports companies who have committed to eliminate conversion of natural lands in their supply chains through targets set with the SBTN land sector framework.

**Climate**
1. The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2024 annual global climate report](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202413); 2024 is officially the planet's [warmest year on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record). The 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. Additionally, the Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to its second-lowest extent on record, as well as the upper ocean heat content, the amount of heat stored in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, was the highest on record. Ocean heat content is a key climate indicator because the ocean stores 90% of the excess heat in the Earth system, and the five highest values have all occurred in the last five years.

2. [Wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area since the 7th of January](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained), displacing tens of thousands of people and destroying large areas. While California is no stranger to summer wildfires (typically starting in June and continuing through October when the weather is hot and dry), this January outbreak is an outlier, fueled by unusually severe fire weather conditions across the state's southern region. During most years, no fire alerts are detected in Los Angeles in the first three months of the year. Only in 2021, one of the most devastating years regarding wildfires in California, more than 10 fire alerts had been detected between January and March. In 2025, over 170 fire alerts had been detected by the 13th of January. 

3. The United Kingdom Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is leading a [significant 5-year research initiative](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/international-science-net-zero-plus), focussing on the effects of climate change on air and water quality, land use, and estimating the potential for greenhouse gas removal. To expand the accessibility of the program's digital outputs beyond academic papers and reports, UKCEH has chosen the [online platform MapX for wider dissemination](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/adsfoiuv9). 

**Oceans**
1. The [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network is playing a crucial role in understanding and protecting the vital ecosystem of the Northern California Current](https://marinebon.org/the-marine-biodiversity-network-keeps-an-eye-on-the-california-current/). Researchers and agencies are being brought together, and MBON is facilitating collaboration and data sharing, enabling scientists to study the current dynamics more effectively. As the current delivers cool water from the north (British Columbia), wind driven upwelling brings colder, nutrient-rich water from the ocean depths up to the surface. Those nutrients give a boost to marine phytoplankton that feed whales, seals, seabirds and other wildlife, as well as the iconic seafood of the Oregon coast and the fishing communities that depend on them. Understanding the past and present of the current, will enable everyone depending on it to be as ready as possible for an uncertain future.

2. A new study, [published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4541-3), has found that ocean warming in 2024 has led to [new record high temperatures](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sea-surface-and-deeper-water-temperatures-reached-new-record-high-2024) and discusses how a hotter ocean affects our lives on land and what this means for our future. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 meters ocean heat content increased by 16 zettajoules, which was approximately 40 times the world's total electricity generation in 2023. Ocean heat is the best measurement to monitor climate change. Increasing ocean heat content affects marine ecosystems, currents, sea ice, the way water separates into layers, climate variation and evolution, global weather systems, ocean-atmosphere interactions, sea level, the ocean's carbon cycle, oxygen levels, and human livelihoods. 

3. The Copernicus Marine Service [announced](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-release-copernicus-marine-toolbox) the latest major release of the [Copernicus Marine Toolbox](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/collections/9080063-copernicus-marine-toolbox), bringing a host of enhancements, such as a greater flexibility for integrating with diverse workflows, from high-performance computing systems to lightweight solutions like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.

4. International networks, citizen science initiatives, research institutes, universities and NGOs [working on marine biodiversity data are invited to participate in the DTO Bioflow second open call for marine biodiversity (monitoring) data](https://www.obis.org/2025/01/17/eudto-2ndcall/). These calls invite institutions to contribute to the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO) by making their data available through EMODnet Biology, a portal providing open, free access to interoperable data on the temporal and spatial distribution of marine species (e.g., angiosperms, benthos, birds, fish, macroalgae, mammals, reptiles, phyto- and zooplankton) from European regional seas. EMODnet runs the European OBIS node, so data in EMODnet also flows to the global OBIS data platform. Selected participants will receive funding of up to €60,000 per institution to support integrating their data into the EU DTO. The [submission deadline is the 28th of February 2025](https://dto-bioflow.eu/second-open-call-marine-biodiversity-data).

5. As the Ocean Decade enters its midpoint, [a new batch of 39 Decade Actions is setting the stage for transformative ocean solutions](https://oceandecade.org/news/wave-of-new-ocean-decade-actions-launch-the-year-ahead/), driving ocean sustainability worldwide. The new initiatives address ocean pollution, coastal resilience, hands-on citizen science, and a sustainable ocean economy. 

6. At the end of 2024, [51 IOI Ocean Academy courses have been delivered](https://oceandecade.org/news/the-ioi-ocean-academy-another-successful-year-of-outreach-and-global-growth-with-51-ioi-ocean-academy-courses-successfully-delivered-in-16-languages/) globally by the IOI Ocean Academy Directors. The programmes were offered in 16 local languages and dialects: Arabic, Dhivehi, English, French, Georgian, Hindi, Kiswahili, Marathi, Portuguese, Sinhala, Spanish, Thai, Tunesian Dialect, Turkish, Ukrainian and Urdu.  

7. The BNP Paribas Foundation [launches a new 'climate and biodiversity initiative' call](https://oceandecade.org/news/bnp-paribas-foundation-climate-biodiversity-initiative-call-for-projects/) for projects dedicated to the ocean and coastal ecosystems. Applicants can [submit their projects](https://climate-and-biodiversity-initiative.fondation.bnpparibas/en/) from 21 January to the 4th of May. The call is open to all scientific teams from Europe conducting research on subjects focusing on climate and biodiversity related to ocean and coastal ecosystems. 

**New platforms and initiatives**
1. [Planet launched their high-resolution Pelican-2 satellite and 36 SuperDoves of Flock 4G to orbit on SpaceX's Transporter-12 Rideshare mission](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-launches-high-resolution-pelican-2-satellite-36-superdoves/). Successful contact has been made, and the commissioning process has started. 

2. The use of spatial data can be transformative in the face of climate change, biodiversity loss, and development challenges, as it enables national governments, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples and local communities and researchers to make data-driven decisions to prioritise action and monitor progress towards their goals more accurately. To support these decisionmakers, [UN Biodiversity Lab](http://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/) was developed. It [provides](https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UNBL-brochure_English.pdf) historic and current spatial data on nature, ecosystem services, climate change and sustainable development; it helps developing easy-to-understand maps; provides automatic summaries of biodiversity trends and environmental change; and has clear source information and other metadata.

**News and updates about applications**
1. It is now possible to [show maps on a 3D globe](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2025/01/3d-globe-maps-using-a-javascript-sdk/) using MapTiler SDK with just one line of code. 

**Indices and indicators**
1. [Updated indicators demonstrate best practice for positive impacts on biodiversity](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/capturing-the-positive-impacts-of-sustainable-land-use-investment-for-investors). Financial institutions are starting to realise the opportunities that investing in sustainable land use brings. In particular, impact investors are increasingly moving into this space, looking to add investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and ecosystem restoration to their portfolios. Such investments generate not only financial returns, but also have positive impacts on biodiversity, climate adaptation and mitigation, and local livelihoods. However, it is important that these impacts are measured and evidenced robustly, yet cost-effectively, and achieving this balance can be tricky. Therefore, the [Positive Impact Indicators Directory](https://landuseimpacthub.com/en/kpis) was developed by UNEP-WCMC and UNEP in 2019. This Directory contains a shortlist of indicators to help investors measure their positive impact across several areas: biodiversity, sustainable production, climate action and livelihoods. The [Directory was updated early 2025](https://kpi-directory.production.wordpress-linode.linode.unep-wcmc.org/content//uploads/2025/01/Guide-on-indicator-changes-Jan-2025.pdf): Forest indicators were merged into existing biodiversity and sustainable production indicators to ensure clarity in categorising and avoid duplication; ecosystem extent indicators were streamlined; indicators which relied on counterfactual calculations, which was not suitably robust, were removed; indicators capturing ecosystem condition and indicators for species presence were added; and significant flags were integrated in some of the indicators to align with best practices and to guide investors to take action where it matters most.  

2. A groundbreaking new study, '[Governance and resilience as entry points for transforming food systems in the countdown to 2030](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/78839aee-a0f2-4741-aade-67e526f962f6)', published in Nature Food, presents the [first comprehensive analysis of change since 2000 in key food system indicators](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-report-highlights-critical-food-system-trends-and-challenges-in-countdown-to-2030/en). This report shows that tradeoffs are inevitable between food systems goals such as jobs, climate, nutrition, food security and resilience. With stronger governance and better data, these tradeoffs can be mitigated and even flipped into synergies.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. This year marks the [20th anniversary of the Group on Earth Observations](https://earthobservations.org/news/celebrating-20-years-earth-intelligence-milestone-group-earth-observations) (GEO). One of GEO's enduring legacies is its commitment to open knowledge, and initiatives like the [GEO Knowledge Hub](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/) are turning data into actionable insights, integrating citizen science, Indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge technology to ensure equitable access to Earth intelligence. In May, the [GEO Global Forum](https://earthobservations.org/events/geo-global-forum-2025) will be held in Rome, where experts, policymakers and stakeholders from around the world will explore how Earth intelligence can address today's critical issues. 

2. Call for courses for FSCI 2025: from 21 - 25 July, 2025, FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI) 2025 [Working towards Open Scholarship in the age of intelligent automation](https://force11.org/fsci-2025/) will be held. Course proposals can be [submitted until the 24th of January](https://forms.gle/Xv66oRWZzYa1E6MVA). Courses will meet 3 - 5 times during the week of the meeting, and sessions are usually between 1 and 3 hours long. All courses will meet via Zoom.

**Recordings of previously held webinars and online/hybrid conferences**
1. The [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDU0bye92_Y) (including a section on the monitoring assessment) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as_Rd5ZCJkY) session of Marine Life 2030: Advancing biology and ecosystem ocean observations and forecasting, which were organised by MBON, Marine Life 2030, GOOS and the AIR Centre. 

## Agenda for upcoming conferences, webinars and events
*22 January, 2025*, 14.00 - 15.00 CET, Webinar as part of the IPPN Knowledge Café: [How can integrated policies deliver the UN common approaches to biodiversity and pollution?](https://www.sparkblue.org/event/webinar-ippn-knowledge-cafe-how-can-integrated-policies-deliver-the-UN-common-approaches-to-biodiversity-and-pollution)

*29 January, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [introduction](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CewuDyZETdKYMJfSvyeSsQ) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). In this seminar, an introduction and overview of the Nexus and Transformative Change assessments is given, and how they are connected.

*26 February, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [second seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_de9YnGasQj292mPDG-S3sA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). In this seminar, the focus will be on biodiversity as the first and most fundamental nexus element.

*10 - 11 March, 2025*, the third edition of the International Ocean Data Conference, online and in Santa Marta, Colombia: [The data we need for the ocean we want](https://oceandataconference.org/iodc-iii-programme)

*26 March, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [third seminar: Biodiversity](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_E89GSYmMT_2Wv0SPz8dptA) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). A stable climate underpins the continued functioning of all other benefits across the nexus. While climate change mitigation or adaptation actions often have positive impacts on other parts of the nexus, some have potential negative impacts. This seminar will focus on how producing energy has impacts on all nexus elements, so transitioning to low carbon energy and energy demand management will be necessary.

*30 April, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fourth seminar: Food](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_r5RkHrUkSbmUL4p28JuL6g) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Access to food and to live free from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity is a fundamental human right. This seminar will focus on the response options considered ranging from production-based approaches to governance and dietary approaches.

*28 May, 2025*, 16.00 CET, The [fifth seminar: Water](https://wwfus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BH2xMZwaTyGjjiwGSoyv5w) of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). This seminar will focus on the analysis of response options including consideration of interactions between freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems while also incorporating nature's contributions to people.

*25 June, 2025*, The sixth seminar: Health of the WWF [Solutions for the Planet's Interlinked Challenges](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/solutions-for-the-planet-s-interlinked-challenges?utm_campaign=fuller&utm_medium=email&utm_source=surveys&utm_content=250717). Health systems and health policies interact with other elements of the nexus and can strengthen the response to climate change, both on the mitigation and adaptation front. This seminar will focus on how poor outcomes for other nexus sectors translate to poor human health.
