### News and articles

**Biodiversity**
1. The [second systematic review of use of GBIF-mediated data in scientific research](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2519119122), shows that [GBIF data was used in more than 12,000 studies](https://www.gbif.org/news/6ml29qXkAKpr1pu7y3j766/gbif-data-use-surges-globally-powering-more-than-12000-studies-across-180-countries) across 180 countries since 2021, an increase of nearly 30% since the previous 5-year period. Species distribution modelling continues to dominate methodologies employed by the studies, followed by phylogenetics and interaction analyses. Four in five studies focus on animals, and particularly chordates, while nearly all studies of plants involve vascular plants. The scope and taxonomic breadth of articles using GBIF-mediated data seem to trail the patterns of data available through GBIF, highlighting the potential for emerging data streams of eDNA, ecoacoustics and camera trap data to both fill taxonomic gaps and continue to expand GBIF’s scientific relevance and coverage.

2. Living Data 2025, the first global conference on biodiversity data, took place in Bogotá, Colombia, from 21-24 October 2025. The conference was a significant milestone for the global biodiversity data community, acting as a platform for strengthening collaborations, highlighting interconnections, and inspiring cooperation. [5 takeaway messages on the future of biodiversity data through an OBIS lens](https://www.obis.org/2025/11/20/obis-takeaways-on-living-data-2025/): 1. Data depends on people, ultimately, humans connect technology, data, science and action, ensuring that knowledge-based impact benefits nature and people. 2. Working together accelerates data mobilisation. 3. The need for trusted data to support action. Numerous sessions and presentations at Living Data 2025 highlighted the crucial role of data integration components, from standardization efforts to the application of FAIR and CARE principles, and the need for robust Quality Control processes. Ready-to-use, fit-for-purpose, high-quality biodiversity data contribute to sustaining emerging monitoring systems and approaches, such as remote sensing and model-based predictions, and support for conservation actions. 4. Innovation for radical impact. As conservation needs evolve and ecological pressures intensify, the biodiversity data community is developing innovative tools and approaches to strengthen impacts. 5. We need global collaboration on biodiversity data. Biodiversity data is essential in order to address the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.

3. [Imazon has developed AI deforestation prediction models that inform policies and help law enforcement protect the Amazon rainforest](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/brazilian-research-institute-using-cutting-edge-technology-stave), while promoting sustainable economic growth. The dark green area on a digital map, studded with yellow, orange and red dots, may not mean much to an untrained eye. But for the researchers at the Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, a Brazilian and Amazonian non-profit scientific institution known as Imazon, this map tells a dramatic story of the fight for the survival of the Amazon rainforest – the largest ecosystem in the world that produces 20 per cent of the planet's oxygen. Each dot is a place where Imazon believes deforestation will occur, and each colour signals the degree of the risk, based on satellite data and artificial- intelligence-based modelling. In 2021, the year of the map’s launch, these dots helped identify 15,000 square kilometres of high-risk forest areas -- 71 per cent of which was subsequently saved; informed more than 4,400 environmental legal cases and helped uncover 99 per cent of illegal deforestation.  

4. The new [IUCN SOS South Africa country brief](https://iucnsos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Country-Brief_South-Africa-V4.pdf) spotlights species recovery and innovation: in the mountains of the Western Cape, tiny frogs are rediscovering their voices. On Bird Island, African penguins are hatching chicks for the first time in years. And in the rivers of the Cederberg, a fish once thought doomed is making a quiet return. The [launch](https://iucnsos.org/sos-african-wildlife-initiative-south-africa-country-brief/) coincided with a national workshop held in Pretoria titled “Advancing Species Conservation in South Africa: Pathways for Sustainable Impact,” where government, researchers, NGOs, and IUCN experts came together to reflect on achievements and shape next steps under the Global Biodiversity Framework. Between 2020 and 2024, the African Wildlife Initiative invested over €1.3 million across 15 major projects, strengthening the protection and management of over 5.5 million hectares of critical habitats. Through collaboration with partners such as the Endangered Wildlife Trust, BirdLife South Africa, WildTrust, Freshwater Research Centre, SANParks and Wilderness Foundation Africa, these efforts have yielded measurable results for species. Key achievements include zero rhino poaching in reserves during the project implementation; a 17% increase in African penguin breeding pairs on Bird Island; the recovery of the critically endangered Clanwilliam sandfish, which over 25,000 juveniles rescued and reared in predator-free sanctuary dams; the discovery of new populations of the rough moss frog following invasive pine removal and controlled fire management; and strengthened community engagement, providing livelihood opportunities to more than 3,000 people through training, employment and small business support. 

5. IUCN Save Our Species shared [Living Legacy](https://www.bbc.com/storyworks/specials/living-legacy/), a powerful new film series produced for IUCN by BBC StoryWorlds and narrated by the late Dr. Jane Goodall. The [series brings the human stories behind nature conservation to life](https://iucnsos.org/introducing-living-legacy-new-bbc-storyworks-film-series-on-human-led-conservation/), capturing how protecting and restoring ecosystems can build a more resilient, equitable and sustainable future for all. Across 20 short films, Living Legacy explores the real-world impact of nature-based solutions: reducing emissions, strengthening communities, supporting local economies, and ultimately improving lives. From the world’s forests and wetlands to coasts, savannas and protected areas, the series spotlights innovative initiatives led by communities, scientists, rangers, Indigenous peoples, youth groups, and conservation practitioners.

6. UNEP-WCMC [updates the global critical habitat screening layer](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en/news/unep-wcmc-updates-the-global-critical-habitat-screening-layer), finding a significant increase in areas defined as "Potential" or "Likely Critical Habitat". "Critical Habitat" refers to areas of land or sea that have high rates of biodiversity and must be safeguarded by development projects, whereas "Likely" or "Potential" denotes the level of certainty afforded by the data. The update builds on 54 biodiversity features from 22 authoritative datasets to identify 68 million km2 of Likely or Potential Critical Habitat, covering roughly 13% of the planet’s surface. UNEP-WCMC experts screened datasets for inclusion in the update that were the best available data for the biodiversity feature of interest. 

7. The world’s forests are premium assets. They generate priceless benefits — from capturing carbon and generating rain to supplying food, medicine, wood and countless other products. But [neglected forests can quickly turn into liabilities](https://www.wri.org/insights/forests-assets-or-liabilities). Forests face growing threats from deforestation, encroachment and climate change. With their decline, we not only lose the bounty that healthy forests provide; changes to forest ecology are creating new threats to communities — escalating wildfires, exacerbated droughts and increased vulnerability to storms. Like most assets, forests offer more amenities when they are well maintained. But if they deteriorate, we don’t just lose their services. Degraded forests can actually work against communities, becoming major liabilities to people and nature. When forests are cleared, felled trees and branches are often burnt or left to decay, releasing their stored carbon into the atmosphere.  Logging, charcoal production, invasive species or wildfires can damage a forest in ways that fall short of complete deforestation, but still spew carbon emissions and limit forests’ ability to absorb more. In many countries, forest degradation results in more carbon emissions than deforestation. Degrading forests may suffer a death by a thousand cuts as their carbon, biodiversity and water regulation values progressively decline. 

**Climate**
1. The Government of the Union of Comoros today launched a [major new climate resilience initiative](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/comoros-launches-new-us-54-million-initiative-scale-nature-based) backed by a US $10 million grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and US $44 million in co-financing from partners including the World Bank and the French Development Agency. The investment aims to help safeguard 140,000 coastal residents by restoring, protecting, and sustainably managing 6,200 hectares of mangroves, beaches, and upper watersheds that make up the islands’ natural defence system. The five-year project is being executed by the Comorian General Directorate of Environment and Forests (DGEF), in close collaboration with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The initiative’s approach — known as ecosystem-based adaptation — uses nature to reduce climate risks while strengthening food security, livelihoods, and biodiversity. Communities will take the lead in restoring and managing vital ecosystems, including large-scale rehabilitation of mangroves and beaches across the 6,200-hectare restoration area. These efforts will be complemented by watershed conservation to stabilize soils, enhance freshwater availability, and strengthen natural resilience to climate impacts.

2. Across the globe, communities are living with stronger storms, more frequent floods and longer droughts. Cities, farms, data centres and entire supply chains now face water risks that are no longer rare or distant – they are everyday realities. Yet people cannot prepare for what they cannot see coming. That is why Google.org’s $3.5 million philanthropic investment in GEOGLOWS, via Brigham Young University, matters. The [funding will help scale a global river forecast service that gives countries, businesses, and communities clearer insight into the water risks ahead](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/why-google-org-s-3-5-million-philanthropic-investment-in-geoglows-is-a-bet-on-the-world-s-water-future), whether tomorrow’s flood or next season’s drought. Born out of the Group on Earth Observations, GEOGLOWS was created because so many partners faced the same challenge: everyone needed reliable river information, but not everyone could afford to build a global model. The solution was simple and powerful: do the heavy computing once, in the open, and make it available as a backbone for all.

3. UNESCO and its Advisory Bodies, ICCROM, ICOMOS and IUCN, have [launched the first field pilot of the Climate Action Toolkit for World Heritage (CAT) in the West Norwegian Fjords](https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2852) – Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord, a World Heritage property. The Climate Action Toolkit for World Heritage is designed to help site managers integrate climate-risk assessment, adaptation and mitigation strategies, as well as strengthened awareness-raising, directly into their management systems. The draft Toolkit is being pilot tested in the West Norwegian Fjords, one of the world’s most iconic fjord landscapes, characterised by sheer rock walls, deep glacially carved valleys, and numerous waterfalls. The fjord region embodies both the challenges and opportunities of climate action for heritage. The insights gained from the West Norwegian Fjords will inform further refinements of the Climate Action Toolkit, supporting World Heritage properties worldwide in translating global climate policy into practical, site-level action and strengthening their contribution to a more climate-resilient future. The pilot will be followed by additional testing cases in 2026, made possible through the generous support of the Governments of Norway, Australia and the Netherlands.

**Oceans**
1. The Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), in collaboration with Rutgers University’s Center for Ocean Observing Leadership (RUCOOL), the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), and the IOC Sub-Commission for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (IOCARIBE-GOOS), successfully completed the recovery of the Vetlesen Caribbean Hurricane Ocean Glider. The recovery marks a [major milestone in the region’s efforts to strengthen ocean observation systems that enhance hurricane and tropical cyclone modeling for the Caribbean](https://goosocean.org/co-design-news/caribbean-ocean-glider-completes-mission-advancing-hurricane-forecasting-and-climate-science/). The mission, supported by the G. Unger Vetlesen Foundation, forms part of the 2025 International Challenger Mission, a global initiative promoting ocean science collaboration and data sharing to support climate resilience. Models constructed from the data will provide essential inputs for forecasting that will improve understanding of ocean–atmosphere interactions, a key factor in predicting hurricane intensity and trajectory. The mission also highlights the transformative role of applied ocean science in advancing both regional and global weather research. This mission represents the first in a series of collaborative glider recoveries and deployments planned for the Caribbean, furthering efforts to build capacity in marine science, strengthen partnerships, and improve data-driven decision-making for disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation.

2. Established over 25 years ago, the MSC was created to address the urgent environmental crisis of depleted fish stocks and ecosystem damage caused by overfishing. This is done by harnessing the power of the market through certification and ecolabelling, incentivising fisheries to improve by responding to retail and public demand for certified sustainable seafood. While there has been growing demand for sustainably sourced foods and improved regulatory frameworks in different parts of the world over the past 25 years, the challenge is clear: over a third of fish stocks remain overfished. Recognising this, the MSC has chosen to stay true to its original mandate. In 2023, journalistic investigations raised doubts about the ability of social audits to reliably identify forced and child labour in supply chains. At the same time, approaches to monitoring and addressing these issues were evolving, with businesses increasingly adopting more robust due diligence processes. In light of these developments, an expert panel comprising individuals from NGOs, business, and with legal experience in human rights, was convened. After careful consideration of the panel’s recommendations, it was decided to remove third-party labour audits from our pre-entry requirements. While these audits were intended to exclude entities or mandate remedial action if forced or child labour was identified, there are legitimate concerns about their effectiveness for detecting forced or child labour. The panel also considered the MSC’s role in supporting broader industry efforts to address forced and child labour. Their recommendation was clear: support businesses in meeting their due diligence obligations. Due diligence as set in the UN Guiding Principles and OECD guidelines, requires businesses to continuously monitor their supply chains, identify, assess, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts. It is [an approach that goes beyond audits and recognises that addressing human rights abuses requires collaborative engagement, transparent disclosure and continuous action](https://www.msc.org/media-centre/news-opinion/news/2025/12/19/the-msc-s-evolving-approach-to-forced-and-child-labour). 

3. [Ocean Green](https://oceandecade.org/actions/oceangreen/), a Norway-led initiative endorsed by the Ocean Decade combining cutting-edge technology, scientific research and community engagement, has officially introduced its newest citizen-science tool: the [Urchin Density Challenge](https://avaocean.no/news/introducing-urchin-sudoku-gamification-of-citizen-science), a gamified approach to analyzing transect data from underwater field photos of kelp forests and urchin beds. The app transforms real seabed monitoring into a simple game-like activity. [With every count of sea urchins in a small photographic frame, volunteers help scientists track the recovery of kelp forests in northern Norway](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-green-invites-global-citizen-to-help-restore-kelp-forests-from-their-phones/) – an ecosystem that has experienced one of the most extreme kelp collapses on Earth. Kelp forests are disappearing on nearly every continent. In northern Norway alone, more than 80% of kelp forests have vanished, replaced by urchin barrens as grazing urchin populations surged and predators declined. Similar patterns are observed in other regions, from California, USA, and the Mediterranean to Japan and Tasmania. 

4. Built on thousands of years of observation and coexistence, Indigenous and local knowledge systems offer community-driven frameworks for ocean stewardship. However, often Indigenous peoples and local communities are excluded from policymaking or denied their rights to steward the ecosystems they depend on. This year’s climate COP30 in Belém, Brazil, highlighted unresolved land-tenure conflicts and the rising violence faced by Indigenous communities on the frontline of climate impacts. In response, more researchers and Indigenous people are following the [concept of Two-Eyed Seeing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13412-012-0086-8). This means looking at the world with one eye through the strengths of Indigenous knowledge, with the other through the strengths of Western science, and using both together to support ocean health and human well-being. As part of the Ocean Decade, [Indigenous knowledge holders and rightsholders collaborate with the wider ocean science community to co-design solutions to safeguard ocean health across the world](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-science-in-action-how-indigenous-knowledge-advances-ocean-science-across-the-world/). The two success stories below highlight how the Ocean Decade is blending Western science with the wisdom and experience of Indigenous and local communities to advance ocean sustainability.

5. To chart the course of the rest of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (‘Ocean Decade’), the Vision 2030 process was launched in 2023 to develop a common measure of success for each of the Ocean Decade’s ten Challenges by 2030. The [outcomes of this year-long participatory, ambition-setting process are now available as a special series of peer-reviewed papers in the ICES Journal of Marine Science](https://oceandecade.org/news/defining-ocean-ambition-ocean-decade-vision-2030-papers-published-in-peer-reviewed-journal/). These papers underscore the urgency of prioritising ocean health and resilience; securing sustainable financing for ocean initiatives, particularly as SDG-14 on 'Life below water' remains the least funded SDG; and ensuring inclusive, coordinated action across the science-policy-society interface.

6. Building on the long-standing experience of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO in advancing capacity development in ocean science, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030 (‘Ocean Decade’) is launching [Ocean Connector](https://oceanconnector.oceandecade.org/), a new platform that connects those who need capacity development support in ocean science with those who can provide it. The Platform is open to a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, researchers, NGOs, community groups, and private sector entities. It [functions as a matchmaking service, where users seeking capacity development support are connected to partners offering relevant services and opportunities](https://oceandecade.org/news/ocean-connector-a-new-capacity-development-platform-to-strengten-global-capacity-in-ocean-science/). This online tool will empower stakeholders with the skills, knowledge, tools, and resources needed to contribute to actionable ocean solutions. It focuses on supporting underrepresented groups and regions, including Early Career Ocean Professionals, as well as individuals and institutions in Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.

7. The Copernicus Marine Service recently [released](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/sargassum-detection-copernicus-marine-launches-new-floating-algae-product) a new operational Sargassum detection product as part of its November 2025 service update. This product delivers [near real-time monitoring of floating sargassum across the Atlantic and Caribbean basins](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/MULTIOBS_GLO_BGC_SURFACE_NRT_015_016/description?pk_vid=ee6d0b5f1b43f4531767794388212b01), strengthening Copernicus Marine’s biogeochemical product portfolio. The new Sargassum Product is a multi-platform, integrated dataset designed to detect, map, and track floating sargassum at basin scale. Rather than relying on a single satellite mission, the product combines observations from several complementary Earth-observation systems: Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, NASA's Terra and Aqua missions, Landsat series for high-resolution multispectral imagery and GOES geostationary satellites for high-frequency monitoring. At the core of the product lies the Floating Algae Index (FAI) and its normalized variant (NFAI). These spectral indicators use red and near-infrared reflectance to isolate floating vegetation from surrounding waters and atmospheric effects. This methodology allows reliable detection of sargassum even under challenging conditions such as variable illumination, high turbidity, or sun glint.

8. Copernicus Marine Service is releasing [new global coastal satellite-derived bathymetry products delivering 100 m-resolution depth information in coastal waters](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/copernicus-marine-launches-global-coastal-satellite-derived-bathymetry). These datasets are designed to support coastal management, marine and climate research, and the Blue Economy. The datasets are produced using three retrieval methods – intertidal, optical, and wave-kinematics – and are distributed as separate layers, each including a quality index to indicate uncertainty. In addition, a merged dataset is also provided, combining water depth, uncertainty indicators, and an indicator identifying the retrieval method used for each pixel. By combining the three retrieval methods, this dataset allows a full view of the spatial coverage while keeping traceability of each pixel and provides global coastal bathymetry with consistent metadata and quality indicators. The bathymetry variables are delivered as gridded global datasets. Depth values are expressed in meters and referenced to mean sea level. Validation against available reference data shows strong performance across a range of coastal environments, within the limits of each technique. 

9. The Copernicus Marine Service has [launched](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/new-way-explore-ocean-data-copernicus-marine-customisable-dashboards-beta) the [beta of the MyOcean Dashboards](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/dashboards?pk_vid=ee6d0b5f1b43f4531767795215212b01) — interactive, customisable workspaces that put the ocean at your fingertips. Build your own view with maps, graphs and annotations, and explore marine conditions across time, space, depth and variables. The full dashboard supports exploration across time, space, depth, and variables. 
It can be duplicated and fully customised in a user's private workspace. 

**FAIR and CARE principles**
1. [Zenodo, the catch-all repository that allows researchers to archive and share their outputs with the world-wide research community, has rolled out an important update to how deposited records can be modified or deleted](https://www.openaire.eu/zenodo-introduces-a-new-way-to-manage-and-correct-published-records). The new process gives users more autonomy shortly after publication, while maintaining the integrity of citations and DOIs over time. Users can now modify or delete their own record (or the files inside it) within 30 days after publication, no support ticket required. After 30 days, deletion is still possible but now requires submitting a short justification for review by the Zenodo Support team. And even when a record is removed, Zenodo automatically leaves a “tombstone” page behind, ensuring citations and links do not break.

2. Across research-performing organisations and funding bodies, a central question is gaining prominence: Do infrastructures effectively support responsible, transparent, and inclusive research assessment? The [Open Infrastructure Checklist](https://zenodo.org/records/17699724) has been [published](https://www.openaire.eu/a-new-era-for-responsible-research-assessment-begins-with-one-question-how-open-are-the-infrastructures-that-support-it), a structured, accessible guide that assists organisations in evaluating whether a given infrastructure is suitable for responsible research assessment. The checklist translates its core principles into actionable considerations across four dimensions: technical robustness, operational capacity, community-centred governance, and ethical and inclusive foundations. These dimensions, clearly presented in framework output, enable teams to assess infrastructures in a systematic and transparent manner. The checklist is useful not only for organisations beginning their reform journey, but also for those already engaged in implementing responsible assessment practices. It can support procurement processes, internal reviews, policy development, and long-term planning related to research information systems and assessment infrastructures.The most effective way to understand its value is to apply it.

**Advanced data technologies**
1. The Arctic is experiencing climate-related change faster than any other region on Earth, with receding ice, increased permafrost thaw, and eroding coastlines. While seeking to understand and address these problems, scientists working in this remote region often face the dual challenge of vast, complex data and limited training in the computational tools needed to turn that data into insight. That’s where the Cyber2A project comes in: by building curricula, hosting training workshops and webinars, and fostering a community of educators, [Cyber2A is equipping geoscientists with the skills needed to harness artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/empowering-arctic-science-artificial-intelligence-cyber2a-project), in turn enabling more efficient and effective Arctic research. Cyber2A represents a new approach rooted in the same principles that guide NCEAS: open science, shared resources, and training communities rather than individuals. At its core, Cyber2A seeks to bridge three key elements: domain expertise (Arctic geoscience), technical capacity (AI/machine learning/data science), and educational infrastructure. The project’s mission focuses on three key objectives: expanding the Arctic-AI research network, developing customized training materials, webinars, and workshops, and fostering a scalable and sustainable community of learners. As the Arctic continues to be one of the most important regions for monitoring, equipping researchers with the right tools, curricula, and networks to facilitate effective use of AI may be the difference between gathering data and producing impactful science. Cyber2A is helping turn that possibility into reality.

2. Accurate, timely biodiversity data are essential for protecting species and ecosystems. Yet much of the information needed for effective conservation still arrives too late, at too coarse a scale, or with critical gaps. At the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) not to replace field science, but to help close these gaps, ensuring biodiversity monitoring can keep pace with the accelerating rate of environmental change. In a [2025 paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/add02d) led by NCEAS researcher Rachel King, the team conducted the first global assessment of automated biodiversity monitoring systems, cataloging more than 250 existing “digital assets” used to track living organisms worldwide. The findings were striking: most digital assets rely on satellite data, primarily monitor plants at coarse taxonomic resolution, and are heavily concentrated in North America and Europe. Even when data are collected frequently, delays in processing often mean they become available months or years later, limiting their usefulness for real-time decision-making. Machine learning algorithms can identify species from photos or sound recordings, extract ecological indicators from satellite imagery, and integrate data across platforms. Tools like iNaturalist [use AI to suggest species identifications, enabling both scientists and the public to contribute meaningfully to biodiversity monitoring at scale](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/closing-gap-how-nceas-using-ai-unlock-full-potential-biodiversity-monitoring).

3. Infectious diseases pose a major threat to human and animal health, creating social and economic pressures worldwide. Their rapid emergence and spread mean countries need early warnings and impeccable coordination. With waterborne diseases affecting millions each year and vector-borne diseases causing more than 700,000 deaths annually, holistic solutions are essential. [By integrating Earth observation data with epidemiological information, countries can develop decision-support tools that flag potential outbreaks](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/the-contributions-of-earth-intelligence-to-infectious-disease-surveillance-and-risk-monitoring), support early detection, and help protect vulnerable populations. Earth observations such as satellite imagery, land cover, and climate data help us track environmental conditions that enable disease transmission. When combined with disease surveillance, data can support predictive models and real-time monitoring for illnesses such as malaria or dengue. But the potential of Earth observations is not yet fully realised in public health. Challenges include limited understanding of the linkages between environmental drivers and disease dynamics, challenges with data integration, lack of standardised methods, and insufficient training for health practitioners. Additionally, [combining Earth Intelligence with animal health information provides a way to understand the risks of zoonosis](https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/earth-intelligence-and-one-health-applying-transdisciplinary-insights-to-animal-health) (which account for about 60% of human infectious diseases) earlier and act faster. Earth observation data on temperature, precipitation, vegetation, land cover and water can reveal the environmental drivers of disease. Where traditional surveillance is patchy or remote areas are hard to reach, Earth observation provides a consistent view from habitats to production systems. When this data is integrated with in situ and animal health data, it becomes possible to a) see how stressors such as deforestation, flooding or marine heatwaves may increase disease risk and b) support more proactive, sustainable ecosystem and animal health management.

4. [Artificial intelligence has potential to improve emergency and crisis management, but struggles to interpret complex situations - experts tell the European Commission](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/artificial-intelligence-has-potential-improve-emergency-and-crisis-management-struggles-interpret-2025-12-11_en). AI is transforming how data is collected, analysed, and processed, leading to the development of numerous tools and applications in this field. Examples include using AI for drought assessment, wildfire decision support, and weather forecasting models. However, the use of AI technologies in crisis management remains limited. For these reasons, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) asked the SAM to investigate ongoing applications of AI in emergency and crisis management. AI excels in standardised, data-heavy tasks typical in frequent disasters like floods, wildfires and droughts; repetitive tasks like environmental monitoring for early warning systems; and damage assessment and processing social media. However, AI faces challenges in interpreting complex contexts and handling new situations without adequate training data. Moreover, morally complex decisions should not be left to AI tools. The [report](https://scientificadvice.eu/advice/ai-in-crisis-management/) stresses the importance of careful monitoring to ensure AI tools comply with legal frameworks, avoid algorithmic biases, and maintain human control and responsibility over AI decisions. It also emphasises developing benchmarks, guidelines, and codes of conduct. This framework would enable AI testing with careful supervision and ethical oversight before fully deploying AI technologies.

5. Global Fishing Watch and Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory [launch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/press-release/global-fishing-watch-and-benioff-ocean-science-laboratory-launch-deep-sea-mining-watch/) Deep-Sea Mining Watch. The new global transparency tool, [Deep-Sea Mining Watch](http://deepseaminingwatch.msi.ucsb.edu/), will empower governments, researchers and civil society to monitor vessels involved in deep-sea mineral exploration. It provides a dynamic view of vessel activity linked to seabed mineral exploration, allowing users to monitor the movements of vessels historically, or currently, engaged in mineral-related activities; explore data by region, timeframe and vessel speed; overlay exploration patterns with Global Fishing Watch data, such as fishing effort, to analyze interactions between ocean industries; and visualize International Seabed Authority (ISA) license areas, reserved zones and areas protected from deep-sea mining.    

6. Intelligence from above: [how Earth observation and AI are transforming climate and biodiversity action](https://sdg-action.org/intelligence-from-above-how-earth-observation-and-ai-are-transforming-climate-and-biodiversity-action/). A new era of Earth observation (EO) – satellite-based monitoring of the planet – is transforming how we measure and manage environmental risk. But as the view from space grows sharper, so too does the imperative to turn intelligence into action. Climate change and biodiversity loss are often described as twin crises: intertwined, accelerating, and increasingly visible from space. From shrinking glaciers to bleaching coral reefs and vanishing forests, satellite data now provides an unprecedented view of the Earth’s changing systems. However, the challenge is not only to observe, but to understand, predict, and respond. Yet as the data revolution accelerates, decision-making has lagged. While EO has moved from data collection to decision intelligence, many governments and institutions have yet to catch up. The gap between what we can see and what we act upon remains wide. The Earth is now observed more completely than ever before, yet our window to act remains narrow. The true value of “intelligence from above” lies not in the satellites themselves but in how humanity uses their insights – to anticipate disasters, to regenerate ecosystems, and to ensure that the planet’s natural systems can sustain future generations.

**Open calls**
1. The Biodiversity Information for Development programme opened a call for [regional and cross-regional biodiversity data mobilization projects](https://www.gbif.org/news/4uU4o1vqXN95wBTnHS5ZTl/2025-bid-call-for-proposals-regional-and-cross-regional-biodiversity-data-mobilization-projects). Selected projects should address critical gaps in biodiversity data by mobilizing data, promoting its application in research and policymaking, and building sustainable networks and communities of practice committed to sharing open data on biodiversity. To apply, applicants must be legal entities (e.g. research institutions, universities, museums, non-governmental organizations or government agencies) registered in eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean or the Pacific. Organizations with a legal presence in an eligible country (e.g. a branch or regional office), but headquartered in a non-eligible country, will be considered eligible provided they submit their application through their local entity. The project team must demonstrate sufficient previous experience within biodiversity data mobilisation to be able to implement the project. Concept notes should be submitted by 2 February 2026, 16:00 CET through the [GBIF Grants Portal](https://gbif.fluxx.io/). The creation of a new account in the GBIF Grants Portal can take up to three working days. Shortlisted applicants will be invited to submit full proposals in Q2 of 2026. Projects selected for funding are expected to start on 2nd September 2026 and will run for a maximum of 24 months.

2. The second phase of the eDNA Expeditions—a project under the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, supported by Minderoo Foundation, led by OBIS, with technical collaboration of Wilderlab—aims to build a global environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling network across 25 marine sites. Building on the success of Phase I (2022 - 2024, during which 250 young citizen scientists from 19 countries collected eDNA samples that revealed more than 4,000 marine species), Phase II will run from 2026 to 2028. This second phase shifts from a single global campaign to a longer-term monitoring effort. The project includes [capacity development in biomolecular sampling, the possibility to involve local communities in the sampling events, and a rapid information loop that brings results directly back to each site to support any monitoring, management, and conservation needs](https://www.obis.org/2025/12/17/call-for-sites/). Interested marine sites can apply by submitting the [expression-of-interest survey](https://ee-eu.kobotoolbox.org/x/Z3km6BXB) by 15 February 2026.

3. The [Ocean State Report 11 call for contributions is open](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/call-contributions-ocean-state-report-11-now-open). Researchers are invited to propose contributions by 4 February 2026 to support a flagship EU publication that delivers independent, peer-reviewed insights on ocean conditions and change, grounded in Copernicus Marine data and supporting evidence-based decision-making. The SR is divided into four chapters, and contributions to chapters 2 (updated and new pathways in ocean science), chapter 3 (ocean state and change for relevance to society) and chapter 4 (specific events in the ocean in 2025) are welcomed for [submission](https://events.marine.copernicus.eu/call-for-contributions-ocean-state-report-11?pk_vid=ee6d0b5f1b43f4531767794697212b01). At least one Copernicus Marine Service product should be used and data must cover a time period up to 2025.
